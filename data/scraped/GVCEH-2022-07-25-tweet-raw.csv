High housing prices are driving evictions. Almost half are caused by either sale of the home or a demoviction/renoviction. We need more purpose built rental housing so renters are less at risk. We are seeing a lot of this at the Greater Victoria #rentbank #yyjpoli https://t.co/JDuhKYQOaq This is a great @StatCan_eng breakdown of evictions in Canada. The top reasons can really be boiled down to us not building enough purpose-built rentals.
