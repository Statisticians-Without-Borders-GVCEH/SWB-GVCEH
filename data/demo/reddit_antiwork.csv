Need help creating marketing materials,0,rdfrxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdfrxv/need_help_creating_marketing_materials/,4,1639162737,"A few of us want to create marketing materials like posters to be hung up in the cereal aisle, signs to post at work, pamphlets, etc. that users could order and distribute.

I KNOW someone here is a **print broker or sign maker** with an account at 4over, Stouse, etc. Please DM me.

Also, if you have an online store through 4over or some other ordering platform that we could use for people to order these products and you’re willing to sell them, let me know.

If someone wants to write up brief instructions on safely distributing these, that would help.

We need a **graphic designer** experienced in preprint production.

We need someone else to set up a GoFundMe to raise money for these projects.

Let me know if you are interested.",12/10/21 20:58

They'll work to evade, as they always do, but you'll limit some of the generational wealth transfer - and at least make them pay to launder it beforehand.

It would have taken her **9.6 years** to earn $5000 -- IF she didn't have to pay any taxes! Never mind living expenses.

The part that holds up is the dialog *right after* the $5000 statement.

Comment,1,ho3mzjq,,0,1639212914,"Had our first kid last month. Total cost upfront 2.6k plus bill from hospital that's still pending is about 20k. Already paid by insurance was around 8k (c section delivery)

My work doesn't offer any maternity leave.... Hers does

House is 160k at 870/mo

Health insurance + dental+ eye is running me and the kid 600/mo mom is solo at 280/mo (cheaper than a family plan)

Car insurance is ~300 for year for me idk hers

We haven't got to daycare yet. I work 3rds she's on days that's how we're going to be doing it when her leave ends.

My truck 2013 is paid off but her car payment on a 2019 is 380/mo

I'd say 300-600/mo for food. Higher being for when we host the Thanksgiving or Christmas. 

Internet 75 for 1gig up/down
cell phones 175 (could be cheaper but we are in rural)
250~ electric
360-960/year for house gas


Im at new job only at 32k a year I'm severely under paid compared to the supervisor spot making 60-78k.
She's at 46k year

Edit : college debt I paid most of mine outta pocket I have 6k left on it and hers it's been mostly forgiven but was over 90k",12/11/21 10:55

I still don't wear a mask I still haven't been vaccinated and I've been quite perfectly healthy since then, thank you whereas family members that have not been around due to working that have been vaccinated have fallen ill and tested positive for it.

Never under any circumstances go to the clearance clothing section and take the price stickers that mark clothing down and put them on better, more expensive, clothing, shoes, or whatever; that's theft! Walmart has worked hard to generate the profits they have and even if that profit is made with their heels to the throats of their employees it gives you zero right to steal or print out fliers for local unionization and union reps to leave in the bathrooms for employees to read when they attempt to catch a small break from their living hell.

Only other thing to say is, if you need/want the extra money and aren't too tired, then that's your call.

I'd say about 75% the first, unqualified workers

Being a food plant there are a huge number of federal sanitation protocols. Not to mention being the whole plant is grain based, the whole process top to bottom has to be modified by skilled experienced workers to compensate for differences in moisture/quality of the grain. Even more so with wheat, as wheat has to be tempered with heat/water prior to processing to ensure the germ/bran/endosperm split the right way. 

I run a 60 ton/hr soy mill that feeds the rest of our entire plant. It takes at minimum 6 - 8 WEEKS to get someone to a skill level they can babysit, with supervision, a grain mill like Kelloggs. Even someone simple like keeping their raw grain elevators full would take weeks to train someone for. Add in the complexities of being able to balance out for grain quality problems, on the spot trouble shooting, knowledge to predict how changes at the head of the line change the quality specs at the end, You're likely looking at a 6 month period for someone to be considered even a half decent operator.",12/11/21 10:43

It's fitting that his car company is named Tesla. I don't know much about Tesla as a guy, but I do know that he worked for Thomas Edison and had a bunch of ideas stolen.

Edison is an inventer/entrepeneur who is credited with having thousands of inventions patented in his name. But he ran labs where he had engineers working for him and actually inventing the stuff. No clue if Edison actually invented anything on his own, but when it was time to take credit he sure jumped on it!

This is no different than the boss at your job. They have an idea for a project, you and your team work to put it together, and in the end the boss takes all the credit if it's successful (It's another story if it's not).

Seriously, you guys kick ass. Every day our numbers grow stronger and so does our resolve, resources, and collective intelligence. Every single one of you are changing the world. Even if you haven't quit your job, haven't unionized, haven't even asked for a raise. Just simply being here, discussing your work conditions is helping people both young and old realize that they are being exploited. That things weren't always this way in the US, and that things can change if we want them to. They can't ignore 1,300,000 of our voices crying out in unison for change.

We have come across long way from antiwork being a place to vent about your boss. We have become a collective of people across the country, across industries, and across income levels. We have become something that those who own you are starting to be afraid of. But we still have a long way to go before we cross our finish line. Its time we start calling this what it is, a general union of laborers and consumers. I think we need to start formally addressing companies as such. We simply state our grievances with a company, and if they don't address those, we, the r/antiwork community, will fuck you up. We will contact your employees and encourage strikes, we can go so far as to even support striking employees via crowdsourcing. We will boycott your products, and we will prevent you from hiring new/replacement employees. The most crucial part of this actions are concentrated effort, attainable goals, and companies we stand a fighting chance with (I think we can take on 1000-1500 employee companies all the live long day). Its easy to shout ""we want universal Healthcare for everyone right now!"", but these guy are going to shrug us off. We need to set goals like COLAs, wages, time off, and other benefits like tuition, child/elder care, and achievable in-company performance bonuses for all departments and work our way up the food chain until we get not only what we we deserve, but pay for. This is truly what the owner class fears most.

As we grow larger and more effective in our efforts we must keep in mind the attention we will attract. Not just from monied corporations who want to break us, but from political adversaries and even the government. It seems like the CIAs main job is cracking socialist skulls and they've done a damn good job of it so far, domestically and abroad. Because if this, I move that we implement some r/antiwork member requirements like account age, karma amounts, and even community interactions that might be of concern. I know that this slows our member count but it increases the quality or likelihood a genuine person owns that account. Bot farms exist because they are effective. Bots and bad faith actors can, have, and will continue to distort or even destroy online communities that some have deemed problematic. They can do this my manipulating vote counts to suppress important posts into obscurity and increase the number of pointless or less important posts that serve to dilute or shift the intentions of the sub.

It's so unorganized that little things can easily EASILY be missed even if you're attention to detail is top notch.

I took a call and got screamed at because one of my coworkers was supposed to schedule this lady for an inspection today but he's only 2 months new and he must have forgot or didn't do it properly (which can happen. If you schedule under a wrong a code, the inspectors just simply won't go out instead of switching the code to the proper one). I'm not even mad at the new guy who made the mistake, I'm only 6 months in and I make mistakes still.

Toxic employers everywhere need a reality check. I was called lazy and entitled when I couldn't find anything back in 2015 and spent over a year unemployed. Back then I was struggling with depression and was in absolutely no mental shape to interview and land a good career, let alone anything. I was on my own.

Job gaps were extremely taboo back then and nobody gave me a chance when all I wanted to do was work again following a backpacking trip I took for my mental health. But NO, I was assumed to be a 'flight risk' or my job gap meant I was hiding something. Companies and recruiters (the ones that didn't blow me off) saw me as someone to exploit when they realized I was broke and desperate.

Honesty will not reward you in corporate America. Just lie about job gaps on your resume, then be honest once you have your foot in the door at the interview. You will get absolutely nowhere otherwise. Ask me how I know. Job gaps have had 0 impact on my ability to do good work relavant to my field.

At the time I took any job I could. I didn't have the option to consider red flags. I will never forget what I put up with when I worked in cable because I was broke and desperate:

-Micromanaging boss that expected 7 repair visits in a single 8 hour workday. How he gaslit and blamed me when *anything* went wrong (and I was so mentally broken to just believe him).

-Servicing a home, then later seeing cockroaches start coming out of the cable box in my hands that I'm reclaiming.

-Being called on my work cell multiple times because I'm taking too long at a job site... because I'm being meticulous as I'm LITERALLY DRILLING A HOLE through a customer's wall to connect to an outside dmarc. 

-The anxiety and panic attacks I experienced in my work van.

-The customer that wanted to literally fight me because I couldn't complete his repair that same day due to circumstances out of my control.

-The coworker that visited one of my job sites to document every. Single. Mistake. I made after working a full day with no breaks so he could throw me under the bus to my abusive boss.

-Hoarder homes.

-Home completely covered in bird shit inside because the guy had a free roaming pet dove. 

-Management threatening to write me up for being legitamately sick and needing a sick day.

I will never forget how my ""first IT job"" acted like they were doing me a huge favor ""rescuing"" me from that toxic work environment when in reality they were significantly underpaying me in a different kind of toxic enviorn. ""Great company culture"" and a 4pm Friday beer do not pay bills. ""We're a family here.""

NONE of that stuff I described above would fly with me today. You can't exploit people with options and savings. Why is there a noticeable 'anti-work' movement now? Because people like me have been guilted and gas-lit for years to think the problem is themselves instead of our hyper competitive post-2008 recession job market that punishes honesty and demands unrealistic effort and loyalty from workers while paying less and less, while seeing these same companies post the same vapid, fake motivational trash on Linkedin as they always have. I will live out of my car again before I go back to being underpaid by a terrible company. Ubereats pays me better than what I made above.

Good workplaces are out there and I am in a much better place mentally, career, and financially in 2021. No one deserves what I went through to put food on the table and pay the bills. I know my worth and no longer care about my ""professional reputation."" Reddit.com/r/antiwork",12/10/21 19:18

        and: [Eight centuries of annual hours](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/worktime/hours_workweek.html#hours)

*The labouring man will take his rest long in the morning; a good piece of the day is spent afore he come at his work; then he must have his breakfast, though he have not earned it at his accustomed hour, or else there is grudging and murmuring; when the clock smiteth, he will cast down his burden in the midway, and whatsoever he is in hand with, he will leave it as it is, though many times it is marred afore he come again; he may not lose his meat, what danger soever the work is in. At noon he must have his sleeping time, then his bever in the afternoon, which spendeth a great part of the day; and when his hour cometh at night, at the first stroke of the clock he casteth down his tools, leaveth his work, in what need or case soever the work standeth.*  
        \-James Pilkington, Bishop of Durham, ca. 1570

One of capitalism's most durable myths is that it has reduced human toil. This myth is typically defended by a comparison of the modern forty-hour week with its seventy- or eighty-hour counterpart in the nineteenth century. The implicit -- but rarely articulated -- assumption is that the eighty-hour standard has prevailed for centuries. The comparison conjures up the dreary life of medieval peasants, toiling steadily from dawn to dusk. We are asked to imagine the journeyman artisan in a cold, damp garret, rising even before the sun, laboring by candlelight late into the night.

These images are backward projections of modern work patterns. And they are false. Before capitalism, most people did not work very long hours at all. The tempo of life was slow, even leisurely; the pace of work relaxed. Our ancestors may not have been rich, but they had an abundance of leisure. When capitalism raised their incomes, it also took away their time. Indeed, there is good reason to believe that working hours in the mid-nineteenth century constitute the most prodigious work effort in the entire history of humankind.

Therefore, we must take a longer view and look back not just one hundred years, but three or four, even six or seven hundred. Consider a typical working day in the medieval period. It stretched from dawn to dusk (sixteen hours in summer and eight in winter), but, as the Bishop Pilkington has noted, work was intermittent - called to a halt for breakfast, lunch, the customary afternoon nap, and dinner. Depending on time and place, there were also midmorning and midafternoon refreshment breaks. These rest periods were the traditional rights of laborers, which they enjoyed even during peak harvest times. During slack periods, which accounted for a large part of the year, adherence to regular working hours was not usual. According to Oxford Professor James E. Thorold Rogers\[1\], the medieval workday was not more than eight hours. The worker participating in the eight-hour movements of the late nineteenth century was ""simply striving to recover what his ancestor worked by four or five centuries ago.""

An important piece of evidence on the working day is that it was very unusual for servile laborers to be required to work a whole day for a lord. One day's work was considered half a day, and if a serf worked an entire day, this was counted as two ""days-works.""\[2\] Detailed accounts of artisans' workdays are available. Knoop and jones' figures for the fourteenth century work out to a yearly average of 9 hours (exclusive of meals and breaktimes)\[3\]. Brown, Colwin and Taylor's figures for masons suggest an average workday of 8.6 hours\[4\].

The contrast between capitalist and precapitalist work patterns is most striking in respect to the working year. The medieval calendar was filled with holidays. Official -- that is, church -- holidays included not only long ""vacations"" at Christmas, Easter, and midsummer but also numerous saints' andrest days. These were spent both in sober churchgoing and in feasting, drinking and merrymaking. In addition to official celebrations, there were often weeks' worth of ales -- to mark important life events (bride ales or wake ales) as well as less momentous occasions (scot ale, lamb ale, and hock ale). All told, holiday leisure time in medieval England took up probably about one-third of the year. And the English were apparently working harder than their neighbors. The *ancien règime* in France is reported to have guaranteed fifty-two Sundays, ninety rest days, and thirty-eight holidays. In Spain, travelers noted that holidays totaled five months per year.\[5\]

The peasant's free time extended beyond officially sanctioned holidays. There is considerable evidence of what economists call the backward-bending supply curve of labor -- the idea that when wages rise, workers supply less labor. During one period of unusually high wages (the late fourteenth century), many laborers refused to work ""by the year or the half year or by any of the usual terms but only by the day."" And they worked only as many days as were necessary to earn their customary income -- which in this case amounted to about 120 days a year, for a probable total of only 1,440 hours annually (this estimate assumes a 12-hour day because the days worked were probably during spring, summer and fall). A thirteenth-century estime finds that whole peasant families did not put in more than 150 days per year on their land. Manorial records from fourteenth-century England indicate an extremely short working year -- 175 days -- for servile laborers. Later evidence for farmer-miners, a group with control over their worktime, indicates they worked only 180 days a year.

So I work in a small bakery as a baker. I am already going through carpal tunnel syndrome because of my job. When I was leaving work two days ago, I bent down to put on my shoes and my right knee cracked, and started hurting. I really don't like calling out of work so I got up and painfully clocked out and walked to my car. Later on that night, I was cleaning the floor and bent down again to pick something up. My knee did the same exact thing and this time I was in excruciating pain. I tried to get up but the pain was so bad that I fell to the floor. Once I tried to get up, I couldn't walk properly! So anyways, I called out yesterday and today. I am still new to the job and it is hectic around this time of the year but I couldn't even walk up and down the stairs without help.

Of course I have marketplace insurance and couldn't pay it for the past two months so I couldn't even be seen at the doctor's office yesterday. I plan on going back today because I asked my bf for money. 

So now I feel like a failure and I know that my co-workers at this small knit bakery will probably be gossiping about me. Heck, I was wincing in pain at a very visible spot when my knee first gave out and no one asked if I was okay.

We need to stay peaceful but ask for the most change.

We need to take everything posted on here with the utmost scrutiny.

We need to stay on guard.

And most importantly. We need to stay United.

Don't feel complacent, even when they give us what we ask of, and they will, we cannot see it as enough.

Even in those ""golden times"" where minimum wage was livable wage, that's not enough.

Our end goal should always stay the same.

Antiwork. 

It doesn't mean ""freeloading"", or ""Lazy"".

It means the freedom to do what we want. That doesn't mean no teachers or bin workers. There is always someone who will want to fill the roles. 

Give any living being everything they need to live and more and they'll want to do ""work"", they'll want to do ""unskilled labour"".

Because if that wasn't true we would not be here. Money is not something that existed at the start. We compromised and lived as a team, that's why over 250,000 years we are at this point.

Don't negate any of that.

Don't act as though money needs to exist.

For now we'll compromise. But we do this for the next generation, and the ones after them, and the ones after them.

What we lay here could change how work valued.

Am I blowing it out of proportion? Some could say so but is it really out of proportion. 

When you see a man with more money that the combined wealth of 98 percent of the population. (Because yes. It is that extreme) Cannot even give the ones creating that wealth a thriving wage. No scratch that, a survivable wage.

Put on the fact that there are more than 30 people with more wealth than 95 percent of the population. 

Individually.

Homelessness is still a thing that exist!??? Genuinely grasp the fact that we have more than enough homes to accommodate. 

So many issues that have developed more and more as the wage inequality increases.

You look at who were alive 1000 years past and think outdated, foolish. 

So what does that make the us that is now.

Antiwork. Remember, we hold the power. We the people, who create the money in the first place. Who make society work in the first place. Never forgot. And always ask for more. Stay peaceful, and stay angry.

If you've read all of that and thought, well that sounds a bit much don't it? Then even you are still brainwashed by our society. It has always been this extreme. What's extreme is there is a human living with nothing but the cold frost on their nose.

So, I don’t know where to start. My boss asked me “are you [redacted]?” The other day and I didn’t say anything in response. Today, he came up to me and told me to do some shit I couldn’t do. I told him so and he snapped and went off and I told him I don’t like the way he treats me and that I especially don’t like that he called me [redacted]. He FLIPPED and said I’m a liar and that he did not *call* me this word, he *asked* if I am and therefore, I am a liar and need to leave. 

He called my other coworker into the room to tell him I’m being fired and a 15 minute convo, WHICH I RECORDED!!!!, ensued where I explained that he’s basically a big racist, sexist, ableist bully and that he needs to have more respect for his workers and that his business has no structure. 

I don’t know what to do. It’s Christmas time, I have bills to pay and presents to buy and animals to feed. I don’t know where to turn right now but I’m furious and I have the convo afterwards recorded where he admitted he asked me if I’m redacted, but said it was a joke. 

For context, I do office work and live in Southeast Michigan. I will not name the company yet for legal reasons as I don’t know what I’m going to do yet.

If anyone is a lawyer, I would love to hear your opinion. I also don’t want to post or send out the recording yet for legal reasons if there is some sort of case here.

Further context: this morning, I had a bad feeling about everything, so I went through and found every racist email I could find in his inbox and took a picture of it!

If you work here too, you know the one. 

My spouse just told me that they had to hear from informal channels that their director and the next director up have been working from home all week because they have Covid-19. 

This company has posted on the intranet a list of precautions and compliances that they are taking after calling all employees back into the office in October. These include contact tracing and exposure notifications.... which clearly did not happen, if my spouse had to find out about these two cases through back channels. 

I want to contact HR and confront them about this, but my spouse is afraid of the consequences for them if I do. This company is not notorious for retaliation, in fact they are in most respects a really decent company to work for...

I found this sub relatively recently and thought my story might be appreciated here. 10-ish years ago, I was hired to develop process improvement tools (websites/databases/etc.) for different business units. Side note: two months into my time there, real estate decisions were made, eliminating my building and I'm converted to 100% remote work (nice!). Anyway, after about one year on the job, I had cleared my project queue and nothing else was really coming down the pike. The majority of my days were then spent on minor maintenance since most of the tools I built needed a bit of monthly/quarterly/yearly maintenance to stay in good working order. I also handled the status reporting of the processes that these tools were used for. So, one year in and all I'm doing is basic maintenance and running reports. With some extra time on my hands, I figured ""why not process-improve my own job?"". So, for about 8 weeks, I hammered out mountains of scripts, queries, imports, exports and report generation that completely automated my job. I even wrote scripts to automatically e-mail the reports out for me. 

Fast forward two years.  Everything is going great, I'm doing almost zero work yet I'm getting amazing reviews, raises and large bonuses each year. I've moved my PlayStation into my office so I can play video games all day while I stay close enough to my work computer to see if any messages or e-mails come in. I start to get bored though. I'm literally playing video games and watching YouTube 38 hours a week. I can't go out and do stuff since I need to be near my work computer in case someone needs something. One day, I have one of my normal bi-weekly 1-on-1s with my manager and tell them that I have a good amount of capacity to take on some work. Well, nothing came of it, so I mentioned it one more time in a subsequent 1-on-1 and still nothing came of it. I'm not going to keep asking. So, for about six additional years, I basically got paid almost 6 figures to play video games, watch YouTube and scroll through Reddit.

Now fast-forward to spring of 2021. This company went out of their way to let everyone know that they're not laying off \*anyone\* during the pandemic because ""they care"" or some shit. So, what did they do? Of course they laid off hundreds of people in my area (me included) once it seemed like the pandemic was beginning to wane. So, while they technically kept their word...they just held their layoff plans until they thought it was less damaging to their reputation. Overall, I didn't care. I needed a change of scenery and something to challenge me again and I found a new job I really like making a lot more money to boot. 

Folks, you don't owe your employer anything. Take whatever you can get from them and give back the bare minimum. They won't hesitate to lay you off to increase their stock price a penny. We're all easily replaceable, right?

tl:dr - I automated all of my job duties, worked about 30 minutes/day and got paid for almost a decade until they laid me off during Covid.",12/10/21 18:51

I work in corporate, so its quite normal to have chit chat during out shifts, especially if we're spending 8-9 hours at our desks. For context, I had a great year-end performance review, just wrapped up my last one-on-one with my manager of the year, and all is well. We're looking to finish the year off strong, etc.

Till I get a teams message asking me to pop back into his office and I'm wondering if he has another assignment for me.

Turns out, he heard from his boss' boss (executive level) that I was having too casual of a conversation with my colleague (just one specific person) and that in the future, I should refrain from keeping them too long, and just keep it brief and professional. I'm initially confused at first, thinking about all the things I don't talk about at work and what I could've possibly said to set this off. After deliberating with said colleague, we found out that this exec has a reputation of wanting people just to bury their heads in their desk and work and refrain from ALL conversations with fellow colleagues. He's also been grumpy and moody lately, so I guess I'm the first one in sight to complain about. Which is so counter productive. What's worse is that I sit outside of this exec's office and all he had to do was tell me he wanted a word with me. Instead, he chooses to tell his direct report, to tell his direct report, to tell me. Booyah.

I shouldn't be surprised since we've been fully return to office since the peak of the pandemic. He believes that anyone who wants to WFH is a lazy lard and will clock you from 9am - 5:30pm. Meaning he will have his EA take attendance at 9am and clock everyone to be here till 5:30pm. We're underpaid 30% of market rate and didn't even get raises last year, and don't hope to get one this year either. If this isn't a sweat shop, idk what is.

I have a ton of interviews lined up, hopefully something will work out for me. This company is so outdated, average tenure is 2 years, if even that.

Some context for my story- I live in a quiet, rural area that desperately relies on 3-4 months of heavy tourist traffic. A resort town, if you will. For the rest of the year, it's pretty well expected that business hours will reduce drastically and employees will take time off to recuperate, and it actually works pretty well for everyone. Most people get end of season bonuses, and for the businesses that close off-season, their people receive unemployment and typically return to work when it's time to reopen.

""Nobody wants to work anymore."" Everybody's sick of hearing it. When I asked my boss pre-season what we were going to do for staffing and training before we got hit, that's what they said. My first 60 hour week, I asked again. I can't keep this up for months, we're open 90 hours a week, there are only two of us trained up front, I can't do this while managing 14 pages of inventory, I said. ""Nobody to hire, nobody wants to work."" I'd taken two calls that day from applicants, following up. I give my notice, ""I may just not show up one day. This is your warning.""

My first 75 hour week, I reschedule a doctor's appointment. I'd requested the day off no less than 4 times, up to 4 weeks before. 2 weeks later, I missed a family reunion. 3 weeks after that, I missed a wedding. ""Nobody wants to work."" My spouse resets my joints for me each night when I get home, asking why I'm doing this to myself, watching my employer allow this. ""It won't be this way forever,"" I tell him.

850 hours in under 12 weeks.

""I'm taking time off,"" I said. ""Yes, I know I'm the only one up front. No, I don't care. I'm tired, and I have things to catch up on.""
They say, ""can't. Need you up front.""
""You misunderstand. I'm. Taking.""

My first few days at home were productive, but I spent the last few drunk and dreading my return. Took another month of 50 hour weeks before I finally gathered myself up in front of my boss. ""I quit months ago. I'm following up now. Here are the projects I'll be completing in the next 2 weeks.""

Comment,1,ho3re30,,0,1639216451,"I seem to have missed this one. 

>You mention the military industrial complex is trillions” plural. The US military budget is measured In billions not trillions.

The budget is counted in billions but the cost is trillions... I think you are being super nit picky there. 

>Pharma is ~10% of US health spending and also measures in billions. The only thing the US budget measures in trillions is social security (1..1 trillion) and healthcare if you add up Medicare and Medicaid ~1.2 trillion (ok this is cheating).

You do realise that billions annual cost is trillions if enough year passes? Are you OK?

>You seem to rant that there’s inefficiencies but some of your examples are odd. Stock trades in the US are pretty much free (yes deal flow gets sold), so claiming that there’s tons of inefficiency in the stonk markets Design is weird. Every major broker offers free trades at this point. T+2 settlement kinda sucks but we are supposed to go to T+1 by 2024 is my understanding.

Why do you need to go through a broker? That's the inefficiency and there is a margin there that you are ignoring. Also nothing is free, you just don't understand the cost yet. That's how Facebook and Google make their money. Brokers do the same through by gaining your trade information. 

>Banking is inefficient? Like I would call out consumer fee abuse and all kinds of things wrong with banking but efficiencies have massively improved in recent years. Mobile access, Cheques deposits, apps for 99% of transactions, free ATMs commonly offered.

Banking is relatively more efficient these days I grant you.

>Wholesalers distributors don’t generally sell to the public because:
They would have to collect sales tax.

Why do you think this tax exists?

>You want to remake the system? You need to know how it works…

I don't think using billions or trillions makes you gazillions smarter mate. :)",12/11/21 11:54

congratulations on your new promotion to... drumroll please... ""unemployed"" 😂 it's a request there's no law stating that a company has to approve it - and if filing unemployment... good luck they will probably deny you benefits because you had the choice and sound like you would be fired if didn't show and didn't request off in time

this shits normal and its hella fucking hilarious because this is called a ""request"" for a reason - again they have no obligation to approve the request - even if you did apply last year for this year and make you trade your Lamborghini in for a 7 color paint job 1980s Toyota with 3 wheels - all because you went from Microsoft to McDonald's and ordered yourself the ""McHomeless Live-under-a-bridge"" special

This lesson is sponsored by $10 bottles of the shittiest vodka known to man and 3+ month old clothes stankin like piss and ballsweat - fr though for holidays for future reference - want at least 3 weeks to a month+ in advance notice - ngl when the yearly request offs come around - they made us figure shit out who was doing what - who drew straws for Valentine's, St. Patrick's, 4th of July, Labor Day, Memorial Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas & more

the more experienced people didn't have a choice and some were needed 100% as worked in a deli & several restaurants - so we have drawn straws and yes, there were people that didn't show up - idk for me - 40m, single, no fam/kids - it's easy and I love holiday bonus pay - I also like strippers and cocaine and that bonus helps afford ""a good night"" - and what? most places close early on holidays

some don't and I get that, but literally the overtime & holiday pay is worth it - was getting $25 an hour to slice ham & swiss or roast beef and provolone/mozzarella to make someone's uncle shut the fuck up for 15 minutes

and trust me you wanted him to stfu don't lie bc gave you the fucking ""golf channel put you to sleep"" monotone Christopher-Walken-voice stories ""remember when I did this shit I been telling you the same story for 20+ years?"" and every year it gets 3x longer and 28.93% more boring

idk long story short - you could spend a couple hours with family that you will see more the rest of the year than a few hours on a holiday OR you could end up homeless or scrambling couch fishing trying to make the next month's rent money and looking for a new job

there's that rare chance that ""eh well they didn't come in, but so and so is worth it and won't hold it against them"" - if they come to terms ""the other 364 days a year we fucking need that person"" - but mostly it's ""oh you need off & 'it's not my job' (I watched someone pull this shit once) -- ""oh that's right, it's not your job, go clock the fuck out, it's not your job anymore"" lmao I died right there

but fr if you get good at your job and work the holidays and get that bonus pay for holiday hours - the shit literally pays a week's worth of bills for one day's worth of work - another buddy of mine was a manager at FedEx, pulling in over $1500 @ $30+ an hour + company holiday bonus check for $250-500 - and Christmas gift sending paid his bills for 2 months off 1 day of work basically - and I get that not every employer pays the same or offers similar benefits - I also understand others have gf/wife/kids/family

single people have families too - your family should understand if one fucking night of work pays triple what you normally make and literally 2 good holiday checks for 2-3 days pays well over a month's worth of bills and puts bigger presents under the tree and maybe it makes Uncle Rick stink up the bathroom

it's either that or Uncle Rick could be homeless stinking up underneath some bridge smellin like shitty vodka and your gf/wife has that fucking Louis Vuitton purse & pretty dresses and makeup or not - or maybe you and the kids like sleeping in the car and not in a bed? idk your choice but yep most places aren't giving a fuck with 2 weeks to go til Christmas and would say the same shit I would ""Adios, better luck at McDonalds"" when you no call no show to ""have Christmas off""",12/11/21 11:49

Quite literally the strategy fast food companies use is to wring you out for every drop of work you can do, they expect impossible manpower and efficiency, the job isn’t to serve you proper hours and pay either, it’s to use you until you’re done with their bullshit so that you’ll leave and some other sucker will fill in the spot, they know it’s easier to just use this model instead of paying and treating their workers fairly.

Re reading it, I’m not sure if you are after a bunch of business partners or a group of people to share your profits with who aren’t invested financially?

I see you will share all ‘takings and expenses’ which is basically profit or a loss once all is balanced. What I’m saying is as a growing business you would need to up your expenses and not expect an immediate jump in takings, see it as buying a new coffee machine or a new or bigger cool room as you grow. You will eventually pay those off but it will take time. In the meantime it would mean your “profits” are actually sitting in the shop as “plant and equipment” and that could be seen as you tricking your staff who thought they would have profit to share in.

I've spent a lot of time when I was younger accepting jobs where at best the scheduled out time was a loose suggestion, and the idea of insisting you leave on time for any reason was vehemently discouraged.

Comment,1,ho3qlxs,,0,1639215842,"> A “banner test” is conducted to test a train crew’s compliance with Restricted Speed.  Restricted Speed is a speed that will permit stopping within one-half the range of vision.  It will also permit stopping short of a train, a car, an obstruction, a stop signal, a derail or an improperly lined switch.  It must permit looking out for broken rail.  It will not exceed 15 MPH.  To conduct this test, a trainmaster will place an obstruction (sometimes called a “banner”) on the track ahead of a train that is required to proceed at restricted speed on a main track.  The obstruction is large enough (with reflective tape for night tests) for a train crew to see in plenty of time to stop their train.  Similar tests are conducted in yards, where locomotive movement may not exceed 10 MPH.

Dont mistake this theory though, I'm not hugely UBI. I'm more scientific in the approach and I don't really care what exactly works as long as it works and why it works. Any asshole who says they have the best idea to solve these problems is being a dumbass and a charlatan. I like the idea of testing UBI and see what happens to society on small scale and then slowly adopt it that's why I said that UBI was an option.

I feel like with the fall of imperialism and ww2 and USSR, societies have become risk adverse towards experimenting with social systems. While that was fine prior to automation, it's not going to last forever. At some point AI and automation WILL push workers out. We needed to find ways to adapt to the radical change that it will bring.

UBI is just one of those ways to transition into a ""workless"" environment. Not the only one. But the conversation should always be about transition rather than revolution.

Comment,0,ho3qah9,,0,1639215586,"?  Are you unaware that James Madison is ""The Father of the Constitution?""

https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/father-of-the-constitution-is-born

>Madison is best remembered for his critical role in the Constitutional Convention of 1787, where he presented the Virginia Plan to the assembled delegates in Philadelphia and oversaw the difficult process of negotiation and compromise that led to the drafting of the final Constitution. 

The guy who wrote ""Democracy bad; republic superior.""  

Really, this is a very weird hill to die on.

Maybe this will help clear it up?

https://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinnkin5.html

> In Federalist Paper #10, James Madison argued that representative government was needed to maintain peace in a society ridden by factional disputes. These disputes came from ""the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society."" The problem, he said, was how to control the factional struggles that came from inequalities in wealth. Minority factions could be controlled, he said, by the principle that decisions would be by vote of the majority.

>So the real problem, according to Madison, was a majority faction, and here the solution was offered by the Constitution, to have ""an extensive republic,"" that is, a large nation ranging over thirteen states, for then ""it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other.... The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States.""

>Madison's argument can be seen as a sensible argument for having a government which can maintain peace and avoid continuous disorder. But is it the aim of government simply to maintain order, as a referee, between two equally matched fighters? Or is it that government has some special interest in maintaining a certain kind of order, a certain distribution of power and wealth, a distribution in which government officials are not neutral referees but participants? In that case, the disorder they might worry about is the disorder of popular rebellion against those monopolizing the society's wealth. This interpretation makes sense when one looks at the economic interests, the social backgrounds, of the makers of the Constitution.

>As part of his argument for a large republic to keep the peace, James Madison tells quite clearly, in Federalist #10, whose peace he wants to keep: ""A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the Union than a particular member of it.""

>When economic interest is seen behind the political clauses of the Constitution, then the document becomes not simply the work of wise men trying to establish a decent and orderly society, but the work of certain groups trying to maintain their privileges, while giving just enough rights and liberties to enough of the people to ensure popular support.

Seems to me we should focus on the majority ""discovering their own strength, acting in unison with each other.""  Not saying ""our purposefully anti-democratic Republican system is democratic enough.""",12/11/21 11:39

Interesting that patriotism to you sounds like a Workers Union Movement where freedom to chose your own destiny is only ok until you don’t like it. 
What is interesting is people disagree with a CEO’s ideas but have no skin in the game. Chances are the CEO has stock and options at risk. If the company fails, he looses all his invested money but you just loose a job which you can go get another a lot easier that  the CEO let alone recovering his investment. Freedom to determine and control your destiny is the real freedom…

Comment,1,ho3q1nj,,0,1639215386,"Bernie has been long known for his respectful tone and diplomacy. He is a white man from the Boomer generation who has devoted his life to anti-racism and liberating workers from oppression. He has used his privilege in the best possible way.

If he had an aggressive or disagreeable tone he would not have been in politics - especially Congress - long enough for Millennials and Gen Z to even enjoy him at his most earth-shattering for the past few years. People already hate the man, these were strong words for Bernie. We are from a different generation, AOC and Ilhan Omar can say things that Bernie can't, and yet even they get constantly attacked in vicious ways from Republican Congress members. 

No hate for Bernie. I was confused about what you meant. I get that ""You're a billionaire - great, good for you..."" isn't the platitude I would choose but I am not Bernie Sanders and I cannot do what Bernie does with his peers of his own generation. He is a special Boomer.",12/11/21 11:36

And they know “supply chain issues” are temporary so unlike employers in the service sector who are raising wages because they need to open the doors every day, a company like Kellogg’s will wait them out or hire scabs bc “giving in” to the union will simply empower other workers to demand reasonable hours and a living wage - so for Kellogg’s it isn’t just about this plant or even all Kellogg’s plants - it will result in *all* workers asking for reasonable hours and living wages - which it why it is so so important not to let this slide under the radar.  

An employer announcing that it is going to replace it’s striking workforce should not be tolerated and it’s shameful that this is happening.

Comment,1,ho3pup4,,0,1639215236,"Yeah =/

What I am saying though is that this is because the people one can vote for in the Democratic party are all neoliberals. One just needs to get small-time donations around leftist candidates and the second their name is out there, they will crush their neoliberal counterpart in many regions since the majority of the party will likely go for them. This will at bare minimum create a large caucus within the senate/representatives, allowing for greater ""push"". 

I don't know the actual breakdown of the party mind you, but imagine it 60 left, 40 moderate. The party will rally around one candidate in generals because the alternative is a far-right wingnut. The reason that almost all candidates reflect the 40% is because they have money backing their candidates who break free from a crowd of unknown candidates in preliminaries. This then forces the 60 to carry the neoliberal candidate in the primaries for the same reason that the 40 would be forced to vote for a left candidate, that the neoliberal is still better than the rightwing wingnut. 

Even if the party split 50/50 to form a new party, it would just result in 100% republican winning as neither new party would be able to contend with Republicans and both lose. So instead, just put out the left candidate and get attention in the preliminaries so they win. Then the 40 would have to back the left candidate instead of vice versa. Is it that simple? No. But splitting a party to form a third party would only work if you could attract enough from both sides to create 3 roughly equal parties. My bet would be the vast majority of the new party would come from the Democrats, lurching the country much harder to the right.

I get that both parties suck, I do. But I also get that lurching to the right is why we now have a 6-3 Supreme Court who is going to spend the next 40-60 years undoing much of the civil rights as well as basically prostrating themselves to big business.",12/11/21 11:33

Forget operating a machine, we had classes to show everyone how to stop the equipment in an emergency. 

There is no way a new worker — even someone experienced— could use any of this equipment without weeks of training. It took me three months to learn the proprietary software and THAT was a record. Most people struggled to use the networked computers because it was so damned complicated.

Comment,1,ho3pmgn,,0,1639215056,"I can't talk about other countries, but I can talk about mine (Australia).

I live in Sydney, NSW. There are two particularly powerful and well-known unions representing certain public sector employees in my state. 

1) Teachers' Federation.

Teachers in NSW are generally paid quite well compared to most other countries, but are overburdened with administrative work, which prevents effective teaching. This problem has been ignored by the NSW government for decades. Internal government documents were leaked and revealed that there may be a crippling teacher shortage in 5 years due to terrible working conditions.

They went on strike for a whole day on Tuesday.

2) Rail, Tram and Bus Union.

These guys argue against the NSW Government often about working conditions, train staffing and wage increases. They held  a few strikes this year. 

Their last major strike in 2017 resulted in a new pay scheme which was generally favourable to their members.",12/11/21 11:30

 Go to a REAL lawyer. tell them what happened. Document every time that you get called a name, anytime you hear your coworkers getting disparaged. being called a r\*\*\*\*\* by your boss falls under the grounds of hostile work environment, which falls under harrassment. 

Go call a lawyer for a legitimate consultation. You'll want one that specializes in labor laws in your area. Ignore everything the legal advice subs have told you and put your trust in YOUR lawyer, because your lawyer will be the only person who will have a VESTED FINANCIAL INTEREST in your case. When you talk to them, do not hold back, tell them absolutely every time your boss or a supervisor may have said something disparaging about you to you, talk about it having negative effects on your life outside of work. Best case scenario, you win a harrassment suit. The worst case scenario is that the lawyer says that theres not enough for a solid case and you dont go to court.

Comment,1,ho3pcv2,,0,1639214837,"This writing was in the making for years:  


>Kmart was Lampert's first majority stake, and he proved to be a better speculator than a manager. A 2013 Bloomberg article excoriates his Ayn Rand-inspired approach: In 2008, he split the company into 30 divisions—which swelled to 40 a year later—each of which reported profits separately and had to compete with the others for resources. Lampert was both strict with money and distant, seldom leaving his home in South Florida.29  
Divisions found themselves acting like separate companies, even drawing up contracts with each other. Compensation costs rose as each division hired its own senior management. These executives, in turn, had to form their own boards, and their pay was determined according to an in-house profit metric that led to cannibalization as some divisions cut jobs, forcing others to step in. The appliances unit found itself being gouged by the Kenmore unit, so it bought wares from LG, a South Korean conglomerate, instead.

You can't change the meaning of a word just to fit your bias. If anything, if you really want to get away from the literal meaning of the words, you could say that an expat is someone with a better financial position than an immigrant, given that the term is often used for people who are well off and decide to live elsewhere.

There's plenty of black rich guys on YouTube who call themselves expats.

I am just pointing out a downside of that option and why one might not make it.

I am not rich. I make a low to mediocre salary in a low to moderate cost of living area. A little over 40k a year. We are lucky we will be able to find a house for 150-200k, assuming no catastrophes or drastic market leaps again.

I am currently desperately trying to skrimp and save to afford a down payment /closing costs for a first time  home buyer program. I am working my ass off to get my family in a place where I  am no longer throwing away money on rent and we can call our own. 

But fuck me I guess because I wouldn't want that home to depreciate and I am trying to think longer term at all. I must be some kind of fat cat because in addition to trying to eek out me and my kid's survival I dare to have the luxious dream of trying to afford a non-manufactured home in the middle of no where middle america.

>Kmart was Lampert's first majority stake, and he proved to be a better speculator than a manager. A 2013 Bloomberg article excoriates his Ayn Rand-inspired approach: In 2008, he split the company into 30 divisions—which swelled to 40 a year later—each of which reported profits separately and had to compete with the others for resources. Lampert was both strict with money and distant, seldom leaving his home in South Florida.29  
Divisions found themselves acting like separate companies, even drawing up contracts with each other. Compensation costs rose as each division hired its own senior management. These executives, in turn, had to form their own boards, and their pay was determined according to an in-house profit metric that led to cannibalization as some divisions cut jobs, forcing others to step in. The appliances unit found itself being gouged by the Kenmore unit, so it bought wares from LG, a South Korean conglomerate, instead.

To try to make it work you have to keep watering it down, and all you get to is a european style benefits system.

Comment,1,ho3ozs3,,0,1639214537,"In Danish the word for scab is ""screwbreaker"".


The word has a double meaning and both are negative and meant as a demeaning term.


The method of striking used back in the 1800s was call a ""screw"", because they'd take turns in which workplace to strike at on any given day, both to keep most of the paid work, but also to keep the employers from being able to hire new staff on a daily basis. A series of many small strikes at random times could hit a broader part of the supply chain while still maintaining the right to get paid for 80% of the days where they did work. They would be working mostly, but as a whole, the supply chain still didn't function. This kind of cross sector organization is very impressive.
The unorganized people breaking the strike were figuratively breaking ""the screw"".

So one afternoon they call me up and ask if I can work not in store A tomorrow but either B or C and to call in at 08.00 to find out which one.

08.00: ""Err not sure yet. Will call as soon as we know"" Fine. Paid day rate so if they want me to sit at home great.

10.30: ""Yeah store C. Get there as soon as you can""

12.00 turn up at C to be screamed at by idiot manager for not being there for opening.

I try to explain but he won't listen. Having complete meltdown because had no staff at all. The girl who had been there that morning  had walked before I got there.

Told him.in clear terms to back TF off or I would walk as well. Oh no. He had lost it.

So I walked, called office who said it was OK, hang around in area as Regional Manager and Relief Manager on way.

2. Unions generally promote based on seniority. Meaning if you bust your ass you are no more valuable than someone who started 2 months before you.


Now of course what is drowned out is the benefits. Who cares if you pay union dues if your wage doubles or more. Unions decor seniority but many companies don't promote at all and union seniority is at least a known factor.

Besides, I don't think a life with UBI should be ""comfortable"", that will incentivise people to work for pocket money. Ideally 15-30 hours would be ideal a week.

But neither communism or socialism has any moral solutions to the problem of incentives to do the job. If given a choice and no incentive, no one wants to play around in garbage or clean people's asses. So the only solution in purely those situations is that you force people to do those things.

So, I think the final point is that eventually productivity doesn't become the goal or the requirement. That would be when technology replaces workers. But you'd need to position social safety nets so people are accustomed to not need to work and you just elimate the human presence from the core system.

Comment,1,ho3nuan,,0,1639213601,"I have an alternate proposal: Income tax that takes in all of their benefits, allowances and salary. Give everyone a tax free threshold; in other words, every dollar you make below say $10,000 per year isn't taxed. EVERYTHING above that is taxed at 18% up to a threshold of $100,000. Anything above that is taxed at 40%. You can claim deductions on this amount, but you can only reduce your tax bill down to 20% of all taxes above the $100,000 threshold. NO exceptions. If you did this, then people would be paying their fair share of tax. It means that people would still donate to charities to reduce their tax bill, and still be buying assets for their businesses.

Australia does have a bracket system of income taxes:

0- $18,200: No tax  
$18,201- $37,000: 19%  
$37,001- $90,000: 32.5%  
$90,001- $180,000: 37%

But they won't work to get the satisfaction and positive feeling because you can easily get it elsewhere, provided you don't have to worry about making money to survive.

Comment,1,ho3na6x,,0,1639213156,"The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) allows almost all US employees to discuss pay. They will prosecute employers aggressively for restricting these rights. Please look up this law and share with your coworkers. 

""Employees who are not represented by a union also have rights under the NLRA. Specifically, the National Labor Relations Board protects the rights of employees to engage in “concerted activity”,  which is when two or more employees take action for their mutual aid or protection regarding terms and conditions of employment. A single employee may also engage in protected concerted activity if he or she is acting on the authority of other employees, bringing group complaints to the employer’s attention, trying to induce group action, or seeking to prepare for group action.

A few examples of protected concerted activities are:

Two or more employees addressing their employer about improving their pay.

Two or more employees discussing work-related issues beyond pay, such as safety concerns, with each other.

An employee speaking to an employer on behalf of one or more co-workers about improving workplace conditions.

The law we enforce gives employees the right to act together to try to improve their pay and working conditions, with or without a union. If employees are fired, suspended, or otherwise penalized for taking part in protected group activity, the National Labor Relations Board will fight to restore what was unlawfully taken away.""",12/11/21 10:59

Comment,5,ho3n9sn,,0,1639213146,"Bit of a long story, but pretty ridiculous. 

TL;DR: I got written up for getting locked in a freezer for almost 20 minutes.

A few years ago I worked at a certain fast food place that will remain unnamed. It was a day like any other. I went into the freezer to grab some stock and the door slammed shut behind me. No big deal, yeah? Not on your life. See, the handle to open the door from the inside was missing entirely. I tried looking around around to see if maybe it fell out or something, but no. It was just gone. I did the next best thing and pulled out my cell phone to attempt calling the front except. . . There was no signal in the freezer.  

Believe me when I say I tried my best to stay calm while calling out for ANYBODY and banging on that door for what seemed like forever. I was dressed for summer and the cold was seeping in *fast*

It took nearly 20 minutes for a coworker to finally come and open the door to find me in the midst of a panic attack (I have CPTSD) and bawling. When I told my manager about the broken door and made the comment that things could have ended differently if coworker hadn’t come along in time, I was written up for “*taking an unauthorized break.*” She then had the absolute gall to tell me I was lucky she didn’t fire me for breaking the door just to get out of work. 

Found out from the janitor immediately after that the door had been broken since 3rd shift (I was 1st shift) and the manager was made well aware of this. Not sure wtf my manager’s deal was, but I didn’t come in for another shift after.",12/11/21 10:59

He says that people were only allowed to do their own specific jobs and that they couldn't branch out and cover for someone who wasn't there. They also had to take breaks every 2 hours for 15 minutes which crippled productivity because they had to pack away their tools and equipment before breaks and get them back out after breaks. So really, every 2 hours they had 45 minutes where work wasn't being completed.  Combined with the mandatory hour lunch, the shop was only actively working for 4 nonconsecutive hours per 8 hour shift. Hardly anything got done and customers had to wait way longer for their services than at a non union shop, which ended up killing the business and putting my dad out of work after 24 years of working there.",12/11/21 10:57

Comment,1,ho3n626,,0,1639213059,"While I agree the entire system is rigged in favor of the companies I’m not sure that example is accurate.

If an employee walks into a company store and steal 10€ worth of goods they can call the cops.

If an ceo of said company was invited into your house and then started taking stuff worth 10€ could you also call the cops.

Same goes for the other example, If the company did work on your property and you own them 100€ for the work they have to file a civil suit. Just like you have to file one if they they don’t pay for your work.

People just find it more intrusive when you take something someone is already in possession off compared to refusing to pay back a depth. 

Not sure what the alternative would be? Reintroduce prison for people who can’t pay their debts? Remove private ownership of things, or decriminalize stealing so you have to sue privately if someone takes your stuff?",12/11/21 10:57

You're young, too.

Its interesting we are having this conversation on r/antiwork...because the context is work killing desire to be creative. The writing industry is set up to publish people who don't need to worry about money - because the writers who do haven't had time to finish their books!

Next week…,2,rdz1ys,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdz1ys/next_week/,0,1639226696,"I turn 30. A moment to reflect!

I spent much of my early 20’s in a ‘career’ progressive job but I didn’t take it seriously. I took every opportunity to travel. I didn’t own a house and my commitments were minimal. I saved up and If my boss wouldn’t give me time off then I quit. (One company took me back, twice).

As I approached my mid twenties I started to feel this pressure (societal?) to “progress” in my career. I moved to london, have a successful career and own a house. 
Covid hit and much of my old life feels like a memory.

I’m miserable as shit.

Why? Because (In a short period of time) I was lead to believe that success was about career progression, earning more money and being on track with you peers.

Now I realise that I was more successful before. I had no assets but I had friends, experiences and was making memories.. 

What is it with this system? I felt I was aware and able to determine when I was being lead along, but I was wrong. Now I realise that I was craving a bigger pay check, but each time it came it amounted to nothing. It had monetary value but meant absolutely nothing! 

Works seems to play such a big part in this. Do governments, managers and business owners try to portray this societal narrative to keep us all on track? Who REALLY thinks that we should just live to work? Is everyone just brainwashed or are we all having the same thoughts on the train home from work every night?
Is it really fair to let us fit our ‘life’ in to a allocated holiday window which is dictated by a manager?

Or, am I wrong to blame work? Is this down to a mentality shift now that we can’t travel or experience things due to covid?

I feel ashamed to be moaning so apologies for offloading. Im 30 and fortunate. Some of the conditions that you guys in the US face are outrageous.

The boss has always been arrogant, manipulative and borderline inappropriate with thinly veiled sexual insinuations, but I dealt with it pretty successfully by just avoiding him.

Finally, the day came when he emailed me and my co-teacher that there were no longer enough incoming students to justify having both of us. We were instructed to come to his office separately to discuss the situation. 

My colleague went first and texted me after their meeting. This dickwad was planning to have us compete against each other for the job while he played judge, jury and executioner. It never occurred to this self-absorbed turd-splatter that my co-teacher and I had a friendship that didn't involve him. 

So, my time to visit his office. I patiently let him describe everything and go through his whole planned out spiel about how each of us would have to go about stabbing the other in the back for the privilege of being his chosen lackey.

Found this while down a wiki rabbit hole on the history of cynicism. I say we reclaim the word for its original philosophy.,2,rdyta2,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdyta2/found_this_while_down_a_wiki_rabbit_hole_on_the/,0,1639225759,"The classical Greek and Roman Cynics regarded virtue as the only necessity for happiness, and saw virtue as entirely sufficient for attaining it. Classical Cynics followed this philosophy to the extent of neglecting everything not furthering their perfection of virtue and attainment of happiness, thus, the title of Cynic, derived from the Greek word κύων (meaning ""dog"") because they allegedly neglected society, hygiene, family, money, etc., in a manner reminiscent of dogs. They sought to free themselves from conventions; become self-sufficient; and live only in accordance with nature. They rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money, power, and fame, to lead entirely virtuous, and thus happy, lives.[21]

The ancient Cynics rejected conventional social values, and would criticise the types of behaviours, such as greed, which they viewed as causing suffering. Emphasis on this aspect of their teachings led, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries,[22] to the modern understanding of cynicism as ""an attitude of scornful or jaded negativity, especially a general distrust of the integrity or professed motives of others.""[23] This modern definition of cynicism is in marked contrast to the ancient philosophy, which emphasized ""virtue and moral freedom in liberation from desire.""[24]

I work for a nightclub in Greater London, England as a bartender. I've been working here for 2 months now and every paycheck is an absolute battle to get paid.

First day into the job I was told by everyone to write my hours down on a piece of paper or on my notes because management will mess it up. I didn't think it was a big deal and I started doing it anyway. Fast forward to my first paycheck I was given £93 for the whole month I had worked full time. I went to speak to my manager and told him my hours, watched him put them back into the system. He told me I'd get paid the week after. Suprise no one did. One of the bartenders was missing around £1k so she just left.

Fast forward to the second month. Im writing down my hours and everything and then I catch COVID-19 because we're not allowed to wear masks while serving customers. I had to take some time off with the promise of sick pay. Suprise Suprise, I didn't get my sick pay and my payslip is short by £600 again. I messaged my manager asking him where my money is and HE READ IT and left me on read.

At this point everyone is messaging on the group chat asking where their money is and we get told that HR is taking a portion of our money to give us later as a Suprise!!? Like what? No one agreed to this, no one was told this? And im pretty sure it's a lie.

I'm so tired of working and not being paid. Its ridiculous that they've stolen everyone's money on Christmas. I Don't know how to get the money I'm owed since both corporate and HR are ignoring us. I refuse to work another shift until I'm paid.

For those TL:DR skimmers, you're valid. 

After eight months working *""fast food.""*

I quit over a hat.

Comment your own, *""pettiest""* reason below.

- 

The following is for those who want to read what could've been my villain origin story 🤣.

-

It sounds so juvenile. Till you add every moment of hate and despair. Every moment of dehumanizing cruelty. 

It was 2006, just out of highschool. I needed a part time job before moving states. The plan was to work a full year and save up. 

I was promised daytime shifts and at least 20 hours a week. 

That quickly turned into 50+ hours a week and permanently on graves. 

Which stemmed from spite from a shift manager and her sister when I finally got tired of being sexually harassed. 

The shift manager we will call Twunt and the sister Twat. *(Like Tweedle Dee and Tweedle dumb.)*

Twat would spend her entire shift sitting on her ass. Making elementary school sexual jokes towards me. Calling me a virgin etc.

Every time the pies would expire. She would make sure to throw the cherry ones at me... 

Shift manager Twunt would schedule me around her sister. Have me do work duties around Twat and instruct her that I'm to be *""supervised.""*

Being a 19 year old I didn't realize how absolutely fucked this was. At first I just felt like I was being bullied and creeped on. 

Twat would drift too close as she passed by. Lingering touches when she did so. Leering at me when I talked to any female staff.

A good two months of this shit. 

One night I'd finally had enough. 

I snapped. But I become dead calm when I'm angry. 

Twat threw her last expired cherry pie at me. It hit me square in the eye. Some of the cherry filling came out and singed part of my lower eyelid and eye. 

As I held back the urge to chuck the spatula I was holding in my hand. I coldly spoke at her.

*""It's no wonder you can't get any dick since your shits expired.""*

She immediately went to her sister. After about 30 minutes in the office. Twat clocks out and leaves. While Twunt comes out and glares at me but says nothing. 

The shift went on like nothing happened. It was my Friday. So I went home and chilled and enjoyed my day off. Till I got a call at 9pm from one of my other shift managers that I was three hours late for my grave shift. 

Me being the anxious millennial that I used to be. I flew down there and worked my shift, even though I had woken up super early that day and had to work till the next morning. 

I knew it was retaliation. But I didn't realize how bad it would be. 

I found out not long after by walking in on another shift manager whispering about it to a co-worker. It was because shift manager *(Twunt)* and her sister *(Twat)*. Had a plan to get me to take Twat's virginity. 

A 30 something slovenly woman going after a 19 year old. 

It went unsaid. But that was why I was also hired. I feel this is true because the moment Twat met me she goes, *""oh you should work on my shift.""* Then all the sudden I was stuck working with her. 

Along with being over worked. I had the added luxury of having the hardest duties. 

Not only did I have to solo clean the grills but also clean the vats. As well as scrape down the freezers. Almost every night I worked. I also had to count hundreds of lbs of discarded meat. One chicken nugget at a time to account for waste of product. 

Believe it or not. I was the reason the ice cream machine hardly ever was out of service. 

Ever had to pressure wash sidewalks in a thunderstorm? Rain pissing every way but up and feeling the hair on your arms stand on end as lightning cracked overhead? 

I do.

I also know what it's like to have to be told I have to fish out a ten pound turd that clogged the bathroom toilet. Looked like a horse cock curled around the bowl. 

I almost got written up for using old vat gloves *(they go up to your elbow)* we didn't even use anymore, to fish it out. 

Yes I threw the gloves away and no I sadly didn't leave it in Twunt or Twat's car. 

After that my answer was generally *'no""* to anything extra. I did one of the major cleaning jobs above a night. And that was it. 

Some time passed and things calmed down a bit. 

One day I went to the river with some friends and my dumbass decided to cliff jump. I was fine on the first jump. 

Second jump, the dipshit tag along no one likes of our friend group pushes me. I end up jack knifing through the water and tucked my leg to late. Which resulted in pulling down faster through the water. My knee went straight through the muck. Rock speared my knee cap and shifted it out of place. 

I had to work that night. I called in, I was told I needed a doctor's note to come back to work... I had never called out before or even been late. 

I see my doctor. Who tells me a month of keeping my leg up is best. I was young and stupid and also full of anxiety. 

I went back to work with my doctor's note that stated no heavy lifting, period. That I had to stand in one spot while working. For one month.

So for a whole week that was adhered to. Only because Twunt was on vacation. My main job task was literally just to wrap the burgers etc. 

The moment Twunt came back she scheduled me alone in the grill on a Friday night. A night there was a football game at the highschool next door. I had orders for hundreds of burgers about ten minutes after I clocked in... 

She had given the other two cooks who were a couple their vacation. Making an excuse that she forgot and had her timing wrong. 

I get through that hell. 

Then not long after all the sudden we got new owners. Rules started changing etc. 

We were then told wearing a hat was mandatory and no facial hair unless you hair net it *(which realistically is understandable.)*

But they also instituted no unnatural hair colors as a rule. 

At this point I had a 15 inch blue and white/blonde zebra striped mohawk...

But if it wasn't really visible it was okay. Mine wasn't very visible as I was a cook and kept it all under my hat. 

No issue. Every manager but Twunt signed off on it. 

The night before my next shift I had washed my work hat in the washing machine at home. If you've ever work fastfood. You'll understand why.

When I took it out I realized the shitty plastic bill snapped in half. I got to work and was told I couldn't wear the hat as it was unprofessional. So I asked for a new one and was denied and told we didn't currently have any. If I wanted a new one I'd have to pay for it. As mine should've lasted longer than it did...

I was then told to use my personal hat. I said no as I just bought it and it cost me almost $40.00. It was one of those stupid angel sinner hats 🤣 that were popular. I'm not ruining my personal shit regardless. 

I was then written up and told that when they get hats in. I would receive one and that it would be coming out of my next paycheck. 

At this point I'm livid. I wasn't even allowed to wear a hair net to get by that night. It was either wear my personal hat or be sent home. 

I then asked one of my oncoming shift managers if I could take my first break. I was given the go ahead. Right in front Twunt. 

I do so, smoke a few cigarettes and I just get angrier. But it's at this point I realize I have an old shitty hat sitting on my backseat. I grab it and head back in. 

To be stopped by Twunt. Who informs me I am being sent home for insubordination. 

To reflect on what I had done. 

Which was leaving without asking to take a break. I informed her she saw me ask the other shift manager who said it was okay. We were in fact overstaffed as it was...

Her reasoning was that he hadn't clocked in yet. Therefore didn't have the authority to do so. He literally clocked in right after I did....

Mind you I'm raging but calm. I laugh and go, *""damn and I just found my other hat too.""*

As I glare at her. 

I walk to the back to grab my shit. As I do so I see a new hire in training. Twat is talking to them and says, *""we need to get you a hat.""* 

And opens a top cupboard revealing three rows of fucking brand new hats. Enough hats to outfit at least five stores. That broke the last goddamned straw. 

I left before I set the place on fire. 

I got home and of course was asked why I was home so early *(I was living with a parent at the time.)* I explained to them what happened and their Frank reply was to quit. I asked if they were sure. As we were struggling. 

They informed me that thier plans panned out. So everything would be alright for the four months I had left before I moved.  

So I waited till my next shift, two days later. I had ignored at least 10 or more phone calls and subsequent messages calling me in to cover. 

As their new hires never showed back up 🤣.  

I showed up for my last shift. On a Friday night. Football night. Out of uniform. 

One of shift managers who I was cool with *(who we will call Capt. Badass)* sees me and goes, *""thank fuck I thought you died. We are so short staffed.""*

I saw Twunt lurking near by the office doorway. Itching to give me a handful of write ups for not showing up when called in. 

I ignored Twunt and looked Capt.  Badass dead in the eye. 

*""I'm sorry to do this, to you. But I quit.""*

Twunt was about to storm out but Capt. Badass then just asked me why and if I'd like to leave a message behind. I said sure, told her about the above and then gave her my message.

*""Let that Oompa Loompa, Tweedle Dee lookin' fuckin' orca cunt and her doppelganger perverted twat sister, Tweedle Dumb as fuck know that I quit.""* 

Capt. Badass just says, *""They already know.""* Gives me huge smile and says good luck, that she will miss me. If you took the time to read this in it's entirety. Leave a message stating, ""fuck McDonald's.""

And that's my story about quitting over a hat.",12/11/21 14:17

Insulin vs Attendance Policy,4,rdym2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdym2b/insulin_vs_attendance_policy/,1,1639224991,"This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons

Quick summary:

I work in a medical company in Utah.

Our attendance policy gives you 5 unexcused absences in a rolling year.

On absence 6, you get a write up, absence 7 it's probation, absence 8 is your termination. Once you hit the rolling year mark, a day drops off. 

We get PTO for a day every 2 pay periods. So basically one paid day off every month, and those can stack. That's our vacation, our sick leave, our emergency. 

Fast forward to a coworker's email sent about 20 mins ago, here at 3am:

Hey everyone, 

Last minute kind of request here but I came back from lunch a bit ago and since I’ve been back I haven’t been able to get my pump to deliver insulin properly and which is frustrating because I just changed it before I came in today, Really trying not to go home as I don’t have any pto to use so if anyone has a t-slim pump and has extra sites on them please let me know on teams or through this, I would really appreciate it.

 

Thank you,

* When making agreements about your employment status / holidays / sick leave, make sure to get everything in writing. 
* It's ok to like your boss, but never assume this will always be the case. 
* Talk about your pay with your colleagues. It's not neccesary to do so every day, but checking up once in a while is wise.
* You ARE valuable to your employer, but if there's no risk of you leaving, the incentive for them to work to keep you will be less. 
* Most unions are really good for workers, and if your boss tries to dissuade you from unionising, you should be even more interested in doing so.
* You should NEVER pay to work. If you need a uniform / a computer / a phone / other equipment to do your job, your employer needs to provide this. If they don't? Well... Sucks to be them.
* Taking care of yourself is not being ""stubborn"", ""problematic"" or ""a bad worker"". It is necessary, and it is your right as a human.
* Know what would put your boss in trouble. 
* It's OK not to answer your phone. If they need to be able to contact you, then they need to pay you for it.
* If your work is based on signing up for shifts, remember that taking covering extra shifts is not your problem. Do it if you want to, but you need never explain yourself when saying no.",12/11/21 13:59
"Rough week at work | Emotional vent, need advice",5,rdyafy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdyafy/rough_week_at_work_emotional_vent_need_advice/,3,1639223742,"TL/DR: I'm in a well-paying job, no degree, not much experience, but my manager and some recent mistakes are pushing me emotionally to quit. :)))

Hi everyone,

I haven't posted in a while - I changed jobs, got some respect in the company and felt less ""anti-work"". This is what I get for selling out loooool

Not to give away too much, but I've been working in a fast-paced HR role since June. I've learned a lot. Tried out some new things. Made some friends. Bingo bongo. I definitely felt happier than I was in my previous role

But the last 2 months there's been sort of a decline. I just feel awful and mediocre. I'm assigned a lot of stuff, more so than my same-position coworkers. And my manager doesn't seem to respect me.

He constantly compares me to the person who was previously in this role, pretty much saying I should do more to boost team morale and plan events and buy little trinkets and squ!rt glitter out of my eyes - Whatever it takes to keep the team in good spirits!!! :)))  Problem is, this team is so fucking disinterested in all of that, that I've been struggling to carry out those duties. I'm a fairly introverted person (+ a little shy), which I was very honest about during the interview phase. How I landed the job is still beyond me 

Recently, I noticed my manager talks to the other team members in a very upbeat and friendly tone, but doesn't even look up from his laptop when addressing me. He assigns me 70% of the admin tasks, despite 2 other persons having the same title as me, then expresses his ""disappointment"" and frustration when I fail to meet his borderline impossible deadlines. He sends me emails at all times of the day, as early as 5:30AM, and expects it to be actioned or in-progress by the time work begins at 8. Side note, I'm in office at least an hour early everyday to get my stuff done - It's literally that much work.

But this week, a few of last week's duties got delayed and I spent the majority of this week trying to sort them out. And even when I'm clearly busy with meetings or staff engagement activities or just handling deliveries for the team, he still sends me emails with deadlines like ""this morning"" or ""within two hours"".

Friday was my busiest day yet and I was on my feet all day, barely touching my laptop. I made it clear that I would be away for about 3/4 of the day - He was already aware of this since HE ASSIGNED THIS TASK to me. When I finally got back to my laptop about an hour BEFORE work ended, I see 7 NEW TASKS sent back to back throughout the course of the day. Half of which were due in the morning - When I wasn't even near my laptop! 

Of course, I'm trying to get it sorted and explain that I won't be able to do all of these until Monday. He doesn't look up or respond and I just... I just went back to my seat. I skipped breakfast that day and didn't have lunch until when I touched my laptop at 4.

I have never felt so tired and useless. I break down in the bathroom at least 2x a week and struggle to do my hobbies nowadays. I used to write about action and adventure and doodle these ugly af characters and read books in my free time and blog a little and some freelance copywriting But now, I don't even do any of that anymore. I get so frustrated. 

I woke up at 3am with the most intense stomachache, all because I had such a late meal. It's now 6am and all I can think about is a mistake I might have made at work. I'm sorry that this was such a long read, but idk who to talk to about this. 

I'm the only employed person in my immediate family (mom recently rage quit her job and is pursuing her hobbies as a side hustle - living the dream). I'm in my early 20s. Should I really be putting up with this?

I'm not sure what I want to hear, but I just want to know how to cope. Just typing this out has got me so emotional. Please help me - I appreciate any advice you can give me.",12/11/21 13:55

At the end of phased return I was still struggling so spoke to supervisor who I don't get on with as I stand up to her bullying tactics she did nothing. Two days later I gave HR another maybe fit to work note and had just had occupational health assessment report so handed that to my boss. Nothing was done about the maybe fit note or the advice from occupational health for 17days but during that period I had conflict with my supervisor due to me going for a coffee to perk myself up so I could continue to work advice which was in the report had anyone bothered reading it.

So they take into account the 7.5 working days that I was legally obliged to stay off work and the fact that 8.5 days of my sickness are related to harassment/bullying poor treatment. Yet my supervisor was pinged 3 times not once did she have covid but they allowed her to work from home even though she dont normally work from home, and it had no impact on her sickness record. When u raised a grievance that they still have not completed they raised a performance meeting in retaliation. Should I fight them or just leave?",12/11/21 13:38

Am i unreasonable to want to be able to survive and not be called lazy because i want to actually live my life and spend time doing what i enjoy with people i love? Did we call african-americans lazy when they called to end slavery? No! They just wanted freedom! What freedom do i have when im stuck working 24/7 just to afford a place to live and food to eat?

Does America not have awards?

&#x200B;

In Australia, pretty much every company has to pay their staff according to the relevant industry award. These are long, complicated documents that set out pay rates, casual loadings, overtime,  allowances, dinner pay, everything. Pay rates are set to duties and experience levels ie a level 1 employee is entry level and does xyz, level 2 does xyz but without supervision, level 3 is a supervisor or does judgement stuff, etc up the ladder. This is all worked out between industry, workers groups, and the government. You don’t have to stick to it, you can negotiate separately between employer and employee, but in that case the law is you can’t bargain away your rights for money, and the benefit of the doubt is generally on the employee’s side. 

&#x200B;

If I want to know a pay rate, its all online. If I know my colleagues approximate grading, I also know their pay rate. I read a job description, I can guess the grading and therefore pay rate, so I know immediately if theres a mismatch in pay rate v duties when interviewing.

Nobody is working,7,rdx9dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdx9dh/nobody_is_working/,5,1639219380,"To anyone unaware, when the major social media organizations began banning people with insane misinformation in late 2020, early 2021, Fox News put it upon themselves to add a comment section/home for all of their advent followers, as Fox was, and remains, a key source for misinformation on topics that can kill people. I've been going through the comments since I discovered this incredible anomaly of group think and circle jerking, but constantly see the comments, ""nobody is working"".

Now, just to clear the air here, the unemployment rate is only 4.2%. This is an incredible contrast to that statement, as more people are not only working, but working more hours, for less money, with higher education than ever before in US history. The reason this 4.2% is important, is because it is far more inclusive than it seems.

In the 1960s, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 89% of families were male head of household, with 60% of spouses not working, specifically ""wife not in labor force"". Taking this into mind unemployment rate was 6.6% in 1960 as well. This is important in the modern day, as unemployment is based on two categories, people working, and people willfully seeking employment. If you are doing neither, you are NOT in this statistic. Stay at home parents, or ""wives not in labor force"", did not count AT ALL towards that 6.6% unemployment rate. 

Fast forward to nowish. Obviously the wife row is gone, but as of 2016, an average of 27% wives and 18% wives and husbands were stay at home. The number still sits around 20% total, depending on where you look. The overall point being, basically nobody is NOT working.

There is a naturally healthy point of unemployment that needs to be met. These are people out on disability or injury, seeking better employment, people leaving and entering the job market. We never want to be 0% unemployment. It is not only basically impossible, but also to the point of full indentured servitude. That being said, labor statistics hide a lot of data, and the unemployment percentage hides a lot of people. We are all working, if not for our families and well being, but to survive. 

2020 results have shown as high as a 47% increase in productivity from people working from home, yet jobs are firing people left and right for ""stealing time"". People are claiming federal workers are at home getting paid to do nothing. I'm sorry, but no one is doing nothing. We are all fighting to live. Workers that literally worked from home and overproduced in private industries are now becoming the most likely to get fired. Not because they didn't work, but because they got ahead of it, grew the companies, more than likely didn't get any wage increases, and have much less work to do. They made work a task to get done so they could live more. Instead of freeing them up and keeping their employment, they are being fired, called lazy, freeloaders etc. or, my favorite, being accused of ""stealing company time"", and all under the guise of ""nobody is working"". To add, obviously wives at home taking care of kids that had the luxury of present parents their entire childhood are today's Fox News commenters. The people who had statistically 300% more parenting and babying than anyone born in the last 20 years, are telling us ""nobody is working."" Those that are, aren't working hard. Those that aren't are all freeloaders. Their parents/grandparents being home all the time was a job for them, and isn't considered one now.

We also round time in 15 min increments. Which our company blatantly abuses. I'm in the process of gathering records to send to the DOL for a complaint I filed against them. 

Supervisor: So, management noticed that people aren't on the line running at exactly 4. On the 12 hour shifts you need to be on the line at your start time. Therefore, we will be requiring all 12 hour employees to punch in at 3:53 exactly so that we can round the time to 4. If you sign in before 3:53 you will face disciplinary action for time theft. Also. You will be required to stay until 4:07 before being allowed to leave. This will also be rounded back to 4 and any time past 4:07 will be removed unless approved by management.

Me: No, We won't be doing that. That is incredibly illegal. If you want us to stay an extra 15 min, just pay us for an extra 15 min. That's how this works. We work, you pay. You don't pay, we don't work. I don't volunteer my time for this place, you can, I don't. 

Supervisor: Excuse me?! Yes, you will be doing this otherwise you will face disciplinary action.

Me: Did you not hear the ILLEGAL part? Might I suggest you look into ""don and doff"" laws then come back and talk to us. I'd also like to point out that even with all the ""genius"" college graduates in upper management. your best solution to stopping time theft from the company is to instead steal time from your employees? That makes sense to you idiots? How do you not even look into the laws before you try implementing such a ridiculously stupid policy?

Supervisor: You can't speak to me that way, I need to see you in my office, now.

Me: Sure. While we are in there I can show you the laws and how wrong you are.

In the office I did look up the laws and show him. He was pretty pissed. He tried to write me up and I was like for what?

I work at the OG as a server. I've worked servering jobs for years now and they suck but I'm still in college and it's the only thing I can really get hired as. 

Anyway, in addition to the regular shitty nature of serving jobs this job in particular drives me crazy because management does not give servers a scheduled out time.   At other places I've worked you know about when your shift is going to end and when to expect a replacement. But at the OG? Nope! You have a scheduled in time (and they are real fucking assholes about being late) and then you leave when they say you can leave. You have no way of knowing how long of a shift you are expected to work everyday. 

Nobody else thinks this is a big deal but it drives me fucking crazy! It's nearly impossible to plan around your work schedule because you can't know for certain when you'll be able to leave. To me it really seems like management does not respect our time at all. It's like they don't care if we have lives outside of work. To me it's just common curtosy to let someone know how long you expect to need them. Not leave them guessing and treat them like they are the bad guy for wanting to know their schedule! 

I know I might be blowing things out of proportion but it just really grinds my gears. I know there is no real reason for things to work this way because I've worked at many restaurants where they don't! Why is OG like this? Who fucking knows.",12/11/21 11:31

How do we use the power that we presently wield? What purpose must we unite towards for the future? We must stop this tyrannical oppression of out Civil liberties. Should we be forced to lay down and hope they don't shoot us? Must we once again feel the dreadful scrutiny of their disdain towards our existence?

This is not just bubble inflated, I bought a plot of land in Decentraland and am currently incorporating it with an advertising experience. 
After that gets launched, I buy a condo, increase my rate to $70 an hour minimum (over budget for our industry but idfk) 
And use the extra time to double down on my Decentraland business.
After I see an income over $35K a year from the metaverse alone, I raise my AV rate to $80 an hour, almost unaffordable, and BUST IT on Decentraland. 
Once I’m making over $50K a year from Decentraland I go to $100 an hour minimum for lighting and video design. Basically unaffordable for most gigs so I can spend more time sitting at home - which is just the way it should be.

Also, the sexism in cannabis is astounding. My job mainly aims to hire ciswomen as dispatchers and cismen as drivers. As a nonbinary person, I'm constantly being misgendered and I can't stand it.

Oh boi, do I have you signed up for a crash course. 

These YouTubers, that accept any kind of sponsership; greenwashing, companies that make money by wage slavery, companies that make money by child slavery; They don't care, as long as they get money from it. And usually, as long as it is not obvious within 30s of a google search that this company or that company is shit, they get no backleash. Hell, in Germany the biggest streamer whose main audience are young children to young adults could for a while do casino advertisement. No, even another top 10 streamer on Twitch could do that; The biggest Streamer, 'Montanablack' received backleash after a YouTuber called Tanzverbot *dared* to criticize them - because YouTubers usually have class consciousness. 

They would go so far as to support someone who had beaten their wife, namely KuchenTV. That person beat their wife 3 years ago - or at least it's as good as the truth because his now-wife made a twenty minute livestream crying the whole way 3 years ago & had screenshots showing evidence of a beating on her body. He also did things like continually criticizing feminists for more than a year - earning tons of money for it for basically slowly regressing society and enabling his viewer to potentially radicalize to right-wing views. Someone dared to call him out for it and he got basically 'trashed' by KuchenTV for being his ""biggest hater"". All this kind of shit of being untouchable would've been worked, if it weren't for another big YouTuber called ABK that bought up the wife's livestream. KuchenTV then did three videos; In the first he admitted beating it (with 20 minutes crying), in the second it was a professional statement video with his wife and he wanted to go to therapy and spend 20,000€ to a charity and then his third video.... he said that everything was *supposed* to be a joke, he tried to make a trap for this ""twitter bubble"" (pretty much his 'enemy', which he thinks that progressive people are only on twitter) and ABK. 

And then, hell break loose; now a lot of youtubers began to criticize him for using the topic of ""domestic violence"" to make some money with (in December) and some outright refused to watch him any longer (with reactions, that is pretty much another lazy content farming with advertisement that comes from companies with bad practice)

So yeah, this kind of developed into an example of how bad influencers just are to a specific case in Germany. I hope it did gave you some insight why I just *hate* influencers. Nowadays I just watch very few and got to read more and more lately, as YouTube has just become insufferable when pretty much everyone just *reacts* or does some kind of unhelpful ""I pay 1000€ for someone only helping them temporarily and then receive 10000€ from this video"" - it's like the next big rich capitalist get-quick-rich scheme",12/11/21 10:48

Then I apply and get into the specialty I have always dreamed of. And here I am now. Do you know how much I make?

1600€ per month for somewhere between 160-180 hours of work monthly. Also, I have to pay 500€ + 200€ in expenses for accomodation, so I actually earn 800€. This is one of the cheapest accomodation I could find in one of the cheapest city. All my life for this. Yes you could argue with me that this is temporary, after this 4 years period things will be better. But actually if you talk to other doctors the truth is that this grind does not actually really stop anytime soon and that It might even quite some time before I actually can settle down with a good pay.

And do you know what's the funniest thing? I am lucky. I actually love my job and at least I do earn some money, all the people I know are actually in a worse place than me.

I have notified her that I will not be able to return until I am able to get back on insurance (in the middle of applying) and see a doctor. I also mentioned I’d be able to provide documentation from said doctor excusing my absences and explaining my need for the time off. 

After explaining these things, she responded with the last thing she said to me (direct quotes):

*”I don’t know if I can wait more k need the hours for some one also”*

*”Put your  request please because if not I’m have to do separation for you”*

I have yet to hear from her for nearly a week, but the day after our last interaction, she changed my schedule for the entire month, wiping me off of it aside from two Wednesdays, which I am scheduled for.

I contacted the head of HR, who referred me to a member of their team. I wanted to get some clarity on my current employment status, and to notify them of my current situation of requiring unpaid leave to take care of myself.

They also told me to contact another member of HR, who handles our specific store. I asked for said member’s work email, as I want everything documented.

Shamed by coworkers for taking paternity leave.,25,rdvb73,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdvb73/shamed_by_coworkers_for_taking_paternity_leave/,12,1639211095,"It’s hard to find a company in America that offers it, but my job does. 6 weeks. 12 if you’re a mother. Fully paid, doesn’t have to be consecutive, but must be used in week intervals and before the baby is 6 months old.

I have a lot of issues with the company I work at. After a year from hell, they’re only giving us a 70 cent raise across the board, despite profits being outrageous. We still are working extreme amounts of overtime and I’m consistently taking on other jobs. I have interviews next week and am in the “fuck this place. One more inconvenient thing I’m walking out” mentality. But the paternity leave was nice.

This issue isn’t even with my company. It was my older, a couple years away from retirement coworkers. I took my paternity leave after my son was born, and when I got back, I got shamed? Ridiculed? 

“We didn’t have that. We went to work and sucked it up”
“Must have been nice to have a long vacation”
“Wish I could do nothing for a month and a a half.”
“The mother is the only one who has to be there. You gotta make the money. We’ve been here picking up your slack while you’ve been cozy at home getting paid.”

Small Businesses are Bastards Too,19,rduvi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rduvi1/small_businesses_are_bastards_too/,2,1639209327,"Whenever there are protests or pro-worker policy proposals, people go to bat for small businesses. After all, the mom-and-pop store seems so much friendlier than the transparently evil megacorp. You might know someone who self-identifies as a small business owner.

But workers and employers do not have the same interests, and this applies to small businesses too, often moreso.

According to the [NFIB](https://www.nfib.com/content/resources/infographic/infographic-the-benefits-of-working-for-a-small-business/) 38% of small businesses offer a retirement plan, and 25% offer dental. This is a point of pride for them.

But 95% of large firms offer a retirement plan and 89% offer dental. This pattern continues in [pretty much every area](https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/volume-2/employment-based-health-benefits-in-small-and-large-private-establishments.htm), small business workers are less likely to get [overtime pay](https://www.nfib.com/assets/NFIB-Employee-Compensation-and-Small-Business.pdf), less likely to have paid leave, the list goes on and on.

**Workers and employers have opposite interests.** The more a business pays their workers, the less profit the employer makes. This is true in large businesses and small businesses, but large businesses operate a scale where they can afford to pay workers in a way that small businesses claim to be unable to. Large businesses are also usually the targets of worker organizing, because they have more employees, and thus more people who might decide to unionize, so larger firms are more likely to be union.

Small Business owners are still capitalists, they're still employers, they still have employer class interests, and unlike small-business workers, they are very organized. In every small town, small business owners have a Chamber of Commerce, which serves the same function a union would serve for the working class, but for the employing class. At the national level, they have massive lobbying power, and they have waged an extremely successful propaganda campaign to get everyone to love them. Criticizing small businesses in the US is political suicide regardless of party.

As a result of this enormous political power, concessions won in government for labor have almost always exempted small businesses. Many places require that firms with more than 500 employees offer certain benefits. **This solely benefits employers at the expense of workers, who get fewer benefits.**

The working class and the employing class have no common interests. **If it's good for them it is almost certainly bad for us**. You might say that there are sensible reasons to want small business exemptions; they make it easier to start a business, and competition is good for consumers, keeps prices down and all that, but make no mistake these still come back to benefitting employers at the expense of workers. But these are still pro-employer. The people who start businesses got the money needed for upfront costs somehow, their propaganda makes it seem like they start out like us, but that's extremely rare. If you're rich enough to start a business, you probably don't actually have to work for a living. Some worker is going without healthcare, so that a business major fratboy can ask his dad for slightly less money to finance his startup.

The employing class includes Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, but it also includes anyone who makes a living by owning things and profiting off the labor of others. This is true even if they also help out in the shop; unless their hourly pay is the same as a worker, they are profiting off of your labor.

I remember reading about a lady who owned a coffee shop complaining that she was having to do things by herself because she had no employees and was offering 14 dollars an hour. Some workers might be tempted to feel solidarity with her. After all, she's helping in the shop, doing the same repetitive actions a worker would do. But she's taking home a lot more than 14 dollars an hour. If a drink costs seven dollars, she probably makes back the 14 dollars she would pay a hypothetical worker with 3 drinks, accounting for ingredients and maybe any payments still being made on the means of making coffee. You definitely sell more than three drinks an hour if you work in a coffee shop, and she takes home all of it. If she had two workers, she would subtract the price of two drinks for every hour they work to give to them, and keep the rest, almost certainly a lot more than the value those workers generated.

It's the same exploitative relationship that workers have with Walmart or Amazon, but with a human face, which is usually worse because they take anything that hurts their profits way more personally than even the most zealous manager. Why? Because your bathroom breaks cost mom-and-pop money, which usually isn't the case for even the most zealous large-firm manager (whose pay is unaffected by bathroom breaks.)

Thank you for coming to my ted talk. The working class and the employing class have nothing in common.

A Tale of Anti-work Adventure,12,rduv5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rduv5j/a_tale_of_antiwork_adventure/,1,1639209286,"I have a (former) friend who did some shit I still think about almost every day—next-level gaming the system. 

Many years ago, I and my friends played regularly in video game tournaments around our state and surrounding states. Well, one Saturday I had registered for a local event, but my teammate had something come up at the last minute and couldn’t make it. The entry fee was already paid, so I was not keen on throwing that away. Accordingly, I began reaching out to people within driving distance to try to track down a spontaneous partner. It didn’t take long before a friend responded that he could do it. He said he had to work, but he would still be able to do it. I was confused because I knew he worked at a major chain retailer. I asked him how that was going to work, since the goal of any event like this is to play as long as possible (since that means you’re into the money placements). His response: “Don’t worry about it. I’ll be able to play all day.” Skeptical but intrigued, I agreed. 

The next morning, he showed up to the site ready to go. He wasn’t in his work clothes or anything. I thought it was odd, but I wasn’t overly concerned with the details. We played our morning rounds, and they went as well as one could hope. When it was time to break for lunch, I asked him if he wanted to go grab a pizza. He said, “No, I have to go to work for a bit.”

This worried me because we had more matches in the afternoon, so I pressed for more details. As I walked with him to his car, he was very evasive with his explanation. We got to the car, and I could see his vest and name tag in the passenger seat. At that point I became pretty emphatic that he needed to tell me wtf was going on because I didn’t want to get stood up for the afternoon bracket. So he told me. 

This dude went to work at the start of his grocery shift and clocked in. Then he smooth left the store. He then went across town to the tournament to meet me. He was now heading back to the store to clock out for lunch. He would eat lunch there in the break room; then he would clock back in and return for the tournament. 

I was, again, skeptical of the story. I worked for a different big box store for a few years, and I knew that would be caught immediately if we tried it there. But he assured me it wasn’t the first time. He had determined a certain set of management that, when they all worked the same weekend day, never paid attention to his department/role. He did some version of this every time this set of supervisors was in the store. 

Well, sure enough, he left to go swipe the time clock and then came back in about 45 minutes. Just like he said he would. I don’t remember how the tournament went; we didn’t win. But I never forgot the time clock thing. It stuck with me, and that’s why it was so hilarious when this friend pulled off something even better several years later. 

He basically perfected some aspects of his technique by fleecing the major chain store. But eventually he did quit and took a “better job,” one he thought was actually worth attending…

…for a while. 

His job was in a nearby factory. This factory is run by another major international corporation—a company that manufactures and distributes components used in all kinds of industries. His job, though, was in a sector that manufactured small electronic components. Furthermore, this was a 24/7 factory with 3 full shift changes throughout the day. So needless to say, there was a LOT of changeover and foot traffic at every break time and shift change. Combined with the large number of people, the turnover was also quite high. The job definitely seemed to wear people down quickly, and my fried was no different. Eventually, he decided to try to revisit his old time theft scheme, only dialed up even more. If he got caught, he got caught. No big deal because he was ready to quit, anyway. 

Well, this is what he started doing:

He showed up every morning at the scheduled start time. He blended into the massive crowd clocking in and out for the day. He would swipe his badge and then just exit the building with the crowd that was leaving for the day. 

At the “end of his shift,” he would basically go do the same thing, only in reverse. The workers were so compartmentalized and anonymous, no one knew or encountered anyone from other areas of the factory. 

He did it for a week and expected he would get caught in no time. Then a week turned into two weeks. Then three. Then a month. 

For three months he did this without a single ounce of questioning or detection by anyone or anything. Eventually, though, he got super paranoid about it, and he was stressing heavily about the prospect of eventually getting caught, and how the more he “stole,” the more serious the punishment would be. So he just stopped going altogether. 

After two days of that, someone called him to fire him. They said two-consecutive no-shows was automatic termination. He was to return his work equipment/uniform within 7 days or the cost would be deducted from his final paycheck. I often wondered how long he could’ve gone. Either way, it’s a pretty cool story.",12/11/21 9:54

"Destroy the ""LEAN"" Concept",12,rdumg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdumg4/destroy_the_lean_concept/,10,1639208279,"Bit of background: I work for a huge company that makes about $11.5 billion globally. We were deemed ""essential"" during the pandemic (which...we definitely aren't). The particular department I worked in for 5 long years (until a couple months ago) is classified by the company as ""mission critical"", meaning we work on-site 24/7 throughout the entire year: weekends, holidays, front-end of week (Sun-Wed) 1st/2nd/3rd shift, and back-end of week (Wed-Sat) 1st/2nd/3rd shift. Taking time off is very difficult as they only accept a certain number of PTO requests per shift.

Essentially, this department is a warehouse position mixed with many other responsibilities within the company. I am NOT exaggerating when I say new hires have to learn about 7 different job functions to be successful within the department (with one of the lowest pay-grades in the entire company). And, yes, the turnover rate is about as terrible as you imagine.

They gutted our department in the summer of 2020. Work began to fall behind in all functions the department is responsible for (no way?). Thing is, we support several other critical departments. When we fall behind, EVERYONE falls behind.

Our just *brilliant* management team decides the answer to all of our problems was a 2-prong solution: 1) create ""team leads"" to help the management team in their responsibilities, and 2) put the entire department through ""LEAN"" training.

The first change isn't the meat of my story (which is turning out to really just be a rant about this special hell, my apologies), but I wanted to touch a little on it because all it did was take away our ground-level WORKERS (further shrinking our labor), give them a menial promotion for a whole lot of extra stress/duties, and make our real supervisors much less visible (I only saw my supervisor once or twice a WEEK). Management was allowed to work from home most days. These poor new team leads were basically now acting management without the pay and perks. Many of them left the company within two months.

The LEAN training really got to me. Even being so behind, they scheduled the entire department in staggered shifts for a 2-hour LEAN course. Taking each person off the floor for 2 hours...huge, huge loss of labor hours. Why? WHY? But the worst of it was, the management team presented this course to us, the on-site workers, virtually via Zoom from their homes. There were SO MANY technical problems. They had to get all of the rooms set up (cause only 3 people max could be in each conference room due to distancing guidelines), and when that was finally all done we had a hard time hearing most of the presentation, and the videos were very fuzzy. Ironically, these videos all talked about how WE THE SEVERELY UNDERSTAFFED team needed to think about our daily processes to find ways to be more efficient. One of these videos literally criticized a worker for turning around to grab a spare part from a drawer behind them. I wanted to die.

If that's not insulting enough, we never had supplies needed for our jobs. We always asked for necessary tools to be placed closer to our work stations and management always replied that we'd just have to make do. One of my coworkers told them to reorder something she needed and they never did because ""they couldn't figure out where they ordered it before"" (???) and she, of course, eventually ran out with no support from management. She ending up purchasing her own supply!

To me, it really felt like management was merely trying to place blame on us for being so far behind. The LEAN course was an absolute joke. They were acting like we are machines. You cannot optimize every single second of your work day. Not just because of all of the responsibilities and lack of proper supervisor support, but also because there are unforeseen obstacles that happen daily which will demand an unoptimized work-around. And most of the rules and red tape and hoops they make us jump through simply to do the work they expect of us aren't ""LEAN"" by their own standards. I'd argue a lot of it is contradictory (i.e., to do one task you must forgo another like basic prioritization demands, but then the boss hammers you with ""*Why couldn't you simply get both done?""*).

Luckily for me, I am no longer in that department. But I just wanted to say, employers do no care about you. This job broke me for the last year. I was so stressed and literally forgetting to eat. I'd have to find somewhere private to cry on the job. I started taking an anti-depressant, anti-anxiety medication. If management starts to nickel and dime you for every single second you work for them, or if they gut your department in an effort to be ""LEAN"", please, please, please take my advise and leave.

I am very sorry for the long post. Wasn't expecting to write this much, but the venting helps. DOWN WITH WORK.

EDIT: I also want to give a better picture of the horrid working conditions. The warehouse has no AC in summer, no heat in winter. Some of the summer days got to about 90 degrees. We basically had to wear long sleeves and long pants though, because there was a mosquito problem. At one point, I had about 6 bites on one leg, 4 on the other. In the winter, we'd work with big, puffy coats and hats on. We had to go in every day to work in these conditions. On top of that, for about two months management decides they're not accepting any new PTO requests  because the department was so far behind (and if we couldn't use our PTO over 40 hours by end-of-year, they wouldn't roll over into next and we'd lose that time). Of course, management could take all the vacation they wanted. Absolutely horrendous.",12/11/21 9:37
"Employers need to be the ones ""considering consequences""",25,rduett,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rduett/employers_need_to_be_the_ones_considering/,0,1639207421,"First off, I'd like to congratulate all our espresso specialists at starbucks for successfully unionizing and also congratulating everyone who participated  in disrupting Kellog's attempt at breaking the union. Admirable work everyone. Lets all pause and take a moment to appreciate all the hard work. Smoke em if you got em. 

Now I'd like to go on to the matter I truly want to get to. A post I saw today about Activision Blizzard. Now i dont think anyone is really surprised that actizzard would send out an intimidating letter like that, theyve done it before over other issues so its really no surprise that they would try and stamp down any hope of improvement in their fields. I mean in their offices. By the way, I have one of those ems to smoke but wouldnt you know it, I dont have a match.

Anyways, I was just thinking to myself, ""gee thems some pretty big words coming from a company with how many lawsuites? Maybe they need a taste of just what the 4th Amendment can do!"" And so I sat down and did a bit of thinking about this and, well, since we arent allowed to (red acted) the way that (redacted) did during (red acted), then maybe we should start seeing just how much cyber power we can flex! Anyone got a match? Seriously its like I'm surrounded by smokers here someone has GOT to have a spare.

So why don't we brainstorm a little? How can we send a message to Activision Blizzard that no, its not their employees that need to consider the consequences, but instead, its their asses in the cross hairs, though its possible they already know. Best idea I have is to just make this your last month subscribed to one of their pay to plays or if you stop buying their loot boxes? I mean, the only way to really show civil discontent for these practices is to hist their wallets... but then theyd take it out on the employees... I mean, its already a crummy company to work at already.... I mean, if it got any worse would the employees walk out? I mean, its not our objective to bait employers into doing things hat would cause their employees to take action... Not our goal to force changes in the broken system..... 

Seriously though.... Got a match?",12/11/21 9:23

Seeking feedback on setting up a cafe the fairest way possible,2,rdu80e,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdu80e/seeking_feedback_on_setting_up_a_cafe_the_fairest/,21,1639206650,"Hi all

I had enough working for someone else and want to have my own little business aka a cafe and I'm seeking your feedback on my idea. 

So given that I can't be bothered to work for someone else, I think I'm not the only one and I don't want to make others feel the same, I.e. that they cannot be bothered to work for me. 

Instead of having the common practice of I'm the boss and I'm the one hiring staff, I want my staff to become part of being the business owners, meaning they will directly benefit if the business is going well as they will get some cut of the profits. 

I want to show 100% transparency in the finances to all staff members  and will share all takings and expenses.

Now there will be fixed costs for renting, paying down the equipment. This will need to be covered by takings. There will be also variable expenses like power, gas and water bills. They will also need to be covered. 

I'm thinking that the fairest way of managing the finances is to pay everyone minimum wage (myself included) then pay all the fixed and variable costs and whatever is left, so the profits, will be split equally among all staff members.

If the business goes well, we can collectively decide to increase our salaries over time but at the end, it would not make a difference as the profits are split equally already. 

What do you guys think about the idea? Any criticism is welcome as I want to make sure that this is gonna work.",12/11/21 9:10
Probably the most rebellious act against HR I have ever witnessed,1935,rdu6dy,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdu6dy/probably_the_most_rebellious_act_against_hr_i/,85,1639206472," Today, a well-respected worker in my company decided to call it quits. 

He was an intelligent leader that taught many employees important lessons and skills in both technical and life. While most of us loved and respected him, HR hated his guts. He has been challenging them on every unfair rule and shady actions, and they have been very petty, toxic, and discriminative towards him for it for over half a decade.

Earlier this week, they had a big argument regarding salary and job description. They wanted him to create a “training manual” for all projects, but he refused because there’s too much that goes into it. They claimed his ideas and work technically “belongs to the company” so he offered to send them an invoice for it. Afterwards, he stormed off and HR boldly lied to us they were “letting him go despite his plead to stay.” It was an obvious load of bullshit because we all heard them yelling in the conference room. After over half a decade, it seems like HR won, but he still had one more card left. 

Before he left, he made a small announcement saying goodbye and added a small speech about never taking disrespect from absolutely anyone. Before he officially left for good, he asked us for one last request which most of us agreed to before even knowing what it was. 

He asked us some of us to share our wages since HR was VERY serious about keeping confidential. It wasn’t in any contracts or handbook so no one can get fired for it. A lot of us were reluctant at first, but eventually a few people shared. After the first 2-3 people, things started getting hectic. A lot of people were shocked to find out their coworkers were getting paid significantly more and wanted to know why. Thats when everybody found out that they were told completely different reasons why their wages were completely different. One person was told that their wage was lower because of their experience, while others revealed that they were told experience doesn’t matter. The whole company was in an uproar and pointing out obvious signs of sexism, discrimination, etc. When HR got back from lunch, they felt the wrath of the whole company. HR tried to turn it around on the employees who “violated” company policy, but instead of arguing with them, a lot of people just quit on the spot. I think about 10 people from different departments left immediately, 7 turned in their 2 weeks, and God knows how many others starting looking for new jobs. For the first time in my life, I'm actually excited to go to work early Monday morning to see how this unfolds.

I do inside sales which is basicallyaterial quotes and customer service.

Fast forward 2 years and I've gotten 5 percent COL increase, and there is basically no info on how to secure something better for myself.  For context, our company is doubling up on our stretch goals. So the money is clearly there.  I've also volunteered to take over some really painful accounts and am honestly a good team contributor. He even says so.
In September I said ""I'm happy now, I won't be happy for long.  I finished my degree while working here with honors and I need to be making measurable progress. Recruiters call me on a weekly basis totally unsolicited and when the end of the year comes, I will be forced to take those calls more seriously in order to feel like I'm doing myself andy family justice.""
Him- ""yeah yeah yeah I got you I'm gonna talk to my boss and figure out how we do something to keep you and give you more opportunity to contribute as well as compensation.""
Months of silence. No forward momentum whatsoever.
So I took those calls. I ended up with an offer, terms of which I will find out this upcoming week.  By all accounts it would be way more money, and way more like what I want to do.
So now I'm in shock that I did the thing.
I went out, and with barely any effort, have secured a new position that has the potential to change my family's life and make me souch happier.

I have to admit I am now terrified.  I like my boss but I can't see my current job getting me where I need to go.
My current company aren't bad people, as hard right as they are I do think the owner is passionate about keeping people employed, but if you aren't an engineer with 15 years in the field, I don't think it's something on which you can support yourself.

My perspective as an outsider in this group,0,rdtogj,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdtogj/my_perspective_as_an_outsider_in_this_group/,5,1639204516,"Hi, I haven't posted on here before, mostly I just lurk around this place. I can't say that I agree with everything in this sub, as there are some things that don't make sense to me, but this is what I think.

Employers have lost their minds. I'm not just talking about things with Kellogg's, but many companies in general. The shift of moving away from individual workers to expendable soldiers and automation makes no sense in any capitalistic world. The entire basis of an economy depends on the conditions of the worker and their own salary. In the short term it looks like an excellent idea to treat workers terribly, to ship factories to other countries, or even use robots... In the end it costs everything. If people can't purchase goods, if they can't live on what they make, the corporations will eventually suffer as well. If I can't afford as many goods, or if I lose my job to a robot, there is no chance of me supporting any corporation or local business, and the same can be said to a greater extent once everyone is out of work. No one will provide services that companies need, no one can afford to support these business financially, the production of goods would need to be significantly reduced. 

And why? Arrogance and pride. That saying ""no man is an island"", not in their minds. Just like a king cannot rule a kingdom with no people, a company cannot thrive without people working and consuming goods. People won't want to work for a crap salary, and even if I don't agree with every instance of that happening (since some people have dumb reasons for not working), employers set themselves up for this. Don't like the wages or getting shorted on every check? We can leave, and many of us have. I may not agree with certain things like raising the minimum wage or anything like that, but from where I stand there are several things that this group seems to get right. No one wants to live to be a corporate slave, pay taxes, and die. We want to live, we want places to belong, places to raise families if we want, and to not be stepped on.

Even if we disagree on everything else, at least we can all recognize that we were not created to be slaves to suffering. Thank you for reading",12/11/21 8:35

Anyways, as of this past month, the “higher ups,” or what I would call them... not the owner owner of the store or the mangers, but like the Japanese people from the company have been down for so long in our store.

I’ll cut to the chase. I’m the only white person that works there and the only person, surprisingly, who can speak and understand Japanese. The higher ups can, obviously, but nobody else and they know that. 

They talk with such confidence on the phone or to themselves. The last thing they’re thinking is the whitest person in the room listening in on their fully Japanese conversation. 

They’re raising our price up to $14/H in a few days because they think everyone will quit because it’s “so much work.” It’s extremely weird because it genuinely isn’t a lot of work.

I feel like I may just be saying that but I have been a really lazy person this year and the only thing that bothers me is the commute. I drive normally an hour each day, but now I’m having to drive over two hours.

I requested to be off from the 13th - Jan 1st because I’ll be home from college during that time and I love hours away from my store. I said I can absolutely not work, I said that as soon as I got hired and I mentioned it time after time. Even had it written down twice.

Yet, they put me on 25 hours (5/7 days this week.) like... they said they can’t change it now either. 

Like should I really make that commute 2 hours a day just for that? I mean it almost is double the average...

The previous photographer had left a huge mess of random photo equipment spread out everywhere and I had no time to organize it and very little time to even get used to everything. Nevertheless, I did my best, and the boss seemed happy with my work.

At the time I was hired, I happened to be dealing with a lot of problems related to my illness, and had doctor’s appointments every other week or so. I always let my boss know at least a week in advance, and I never missed a full day for these appointments, just an hour or two at most. At some point, though, my boss called a meeting to talk about how the employees were taking too many doctor’s appointments and that we should really try to arrange them to be on Monday, which was our day off. My doctor is also off on Mondays, so that would not be possible for me. I hadn’t disclosed my disability to my boss when I was first hired because I’m wary of being discriminated against, but at that point, I decided to tell him about it and he seemed to take it pretty well. He promised to not bother me about my appointments and to try and accommodate me however he could.

Over the next few months, things slowly got worse as it became clear to me that the two owners of the business did not know how to manage a business at all. There was very little communication between the two of them, to the point where one of them would tell the employees to do something and then the other would come and yell at us for doing the thing the other owner had asked us to do. They would frequently take days off, leaving the rest of us to scramble to try and figure out what was going on. Th receptionist, who was the sweetest person I have ever met, was a constant target for them to yell at and blame any time things went wrong. One week, the two owners went on vacation and told her not to accept any new consignments. We worked through every single thing in the building and got it listed for sale and photographed, finishing a couple of days before the owners were set to return, which left us with absolutely nothing to do. When they came back, they yelled at her for not arranging more consignment drop offs even though they had explicitly told her not to schedule any that week.

It also became clear that the company was having financial issues. The boss openly admitted that he’d had to take out a loan to make payroll, and this was about a month after he’d purchased himself a brand new Tesla.

Things were getting really bad, so I resolved to stay through Jan 1 and then put in my 2 weeks. New Year’s Day is the biggest sale of the year, and we were promised some very nice bonuses. I’m currently trying to move, so a good bonus could help me pay the fees and deposits for a new apartment.

Well, one day, I was at a doctor’s appointment and had to have my blood drawn. I hadn’t eaten anything that day and I got really faint and nauseous. I texted my boss telling him I’d be running a bit late because I wasn’t feeling well and he told me just to take the day off. I told him I felt fine to come into work, but he insisted.

The next morning when I came into work, I was called into his office. He told me he was disappointed in me, which instantly confused me as I tried to figure out what I had done. Apparently, I had taken too many days off. I’d taken a total of 7 days off in the span of 6 months. Four days for my birthday because my mom came to visit me from another state. I got this approved weeks in advance. One day to go see my grandfather during a time when he was struggling with depression after losing my grandmother. This was also approved far in advance. Then two days where I left early or called off the day of because I was feeling sick.

Anyways, he told me that because I’d taken too much time off, he was putting me on this “employee improvement plan” and that I would no longer be eligible for bonuses for a period of several months, which would extend past New Year’s. I was fuming mad. I pointed out that he was the one who had told me to stay home the previous day and if it was so much of an issue, he should have just let me come in. He made some lame excuse about trying to keep employees safe in case I had covid, but if he really thought I might have covid, he would have had me get tested before coming back to work.

I also pointed out that in my entire time working there I had never been informed about any sort of attendance policy. He said, word for word, “Well, we don’t have it in writing, but I know I’ve told you about it.”

I completely believe this is some new rule he pulled out of thin air because he didn’t feel like paying bonuses. I decided to put in my two weeks to give me enough time to look for another job, but before I could even tell the boss, I found out one of my favorite co workers had been fired. He had also happened to be sick the same day I was, so he got called into the office after me for the same speech. The boss, trying to act all nice, asked if there was anything he could do to make my coworker’s job easier, and the coworker mentioned that the other owner of the business often disrespected the employees. Well, the other owner didn’t like this much, and fired him on the spot. While my coworker was packing up his things, I went to my boss’s office and quit. Fuck two weeks notice. If he’s willing to fire a good employee over something so petty, I didn’t want to be there any longer.

I feel like a weight has been lifted from me now. I managed to find a new job doing the exact same thing with the same pay at a different place within three days of quitting. The new job has an actual employee handbook and clearly written rules. My new boss is a very kind and understanding person who has never once pressured me about doctor’s appointments or other obligations. I am so much happier.

Each time I think about what my old boss put me through, I get filled with rage. I wish I’d challenged him more during our meeting or gotten myself fired on purpose, but at that point, I just needed to get out and did what I had to do.

If anyone took the time to read through this massive post, I appreciate it! It felt really good to get this off my chest.

For those of you reading this, here’s my major takeaway. Always get policies in writing, because a boss will not hesitate to change the rules whenever it is convenient for them.",12/11/21 7:45

I had been working in this team for almost 2 years. I consider myself a quick learner. I picked up the offered certificates (there were three levels). I made sure I got along with all the other departments and made good relations with the workers of said departments. I earned their respect, and that of my team.

Business was booming, and our department generated most of the profits of the company, so they opened more positions. We hired a couple more into our team, and I was responsible to train them. This made me feel pretty good, like I had a shot at the supervisor position. I worked my butt off, designed standards of procedures for jobs that needed them, and the existing ones were outdated, helped them out to learn the ropes and get to know the other departments we worked closely with, helped them study for the certs and get them up to speed.

Fast forward another year, one of our supervisors gets a better offer at one of the branches in another city. At first, I was on the fence about applying, that meant longer hours working and less hours studying for my career goals, but I needed the money, so I applied, but so does one of the new guys I trained. Interview comes and goes, and a month later they announce the new supervisor is the tech I trained. I was happy for me, legitimately happy for him. I was pissed at the Director of operations at snubbing me. I was ready to put in the hours -- I was already working 60+ hours at the job, staying late, helping with schedules, organizing big events, calling clients on their contracts and what not, I had more technical knowledge than the most senior at the department except my supervisor.

A Week passes by and it is clear he isn’t going to cut it as a supervisor. He never intended to help the team and just wanted to sit to “plan” processes when the plans are already laid out by our manager and the other senior supervisor. The team lost all respect for this guy and I was not going to let my time be affected by his incompetence. If it was time to clock out, I was out of the door and I spent all my time studying. The extra 20hours of OT I would instead put them in the books.

I got my certificate after 6 months I started applying everywhere! I will say that I was feeling depressed with all the jobs rejecting me. I finally applied to a job my friend sent me. I was severely under-qualified! He told me “What are they going to do? say no?"" Good point: I applied. After a week they called me in for my first interview (Wut?) I asked my Manager, the District IT manager, and my supervisor for letter of recommendation; they were happy to do them. I brushed up on my studies and went for the interview. I was honest with them in experience level, they seemed fine.
Another month goes by, and I was getting worried they had ghosted me. To my surprise they called me in for my second interview, this time it was with the panel of engineers to test my technical skills. I was sweating bullets during the interview but I did the configurations as they asked without problems, then they sent me on my way and they told me they would be contacting me.

Time went by and the new supervisor was bumped out of the team and placed in another department due to his incompetence. He was costing the department a lot of money in labor hours. I was very hesitant to apply again, but fuck I needed the money, and the other job wasn't in the bag yet. I applied, and so did the other new tech that I also trained! fuck me right? I once again prepared for my interview. 

I finally got a call back from the new job. They offered it to me. I legit cried in the staircase of my current job after I accepted the offer. It was a 100% pay increase from my current one. It was very hard for me to contain my excited. 

A couple of weeks go by and they send me the contract, I signed it. Now it was time to let my manager know. The following day my supervisor asks me if I was going to apply for the supervisor position again. I told him not this time, he told me "" I'm happy for you, now go a put in your two weeks’ notice, I know you got the job."" Thanked him and I went to my manager to let him know, he was also happy for me and gave me a big hug. 

[Post COVID19]
I do not take joy in this part of life. My job is extremely secure, and I was able to jump ship right on time. I am still in touch with my old supervisor and Manager, both of whom lost their jobs during COVID19. No fucks given by the company. Luckily they landed on their feet, they are very hard workers, unfortunately they were too rooted in the old habits of work ethics. 

Its rough out there, stay safe, look out for yourself! The best thing my former Director of operations told me was ""Be ruthless when asking for a raise,"" this was said to me after he rejected my request for a raise. I took it to heart, so I am numero uno, always will be, but I know my roots too and will always treat every position with respect that means that no one is deserving of these unlivable wages! I still am striving for better, this job isn't my end game.

Recently walked out,380,rdsr1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdsr1t/recently_walked_out/,46,1639201107,"Hi all, I just found this community today. I just wanted to share my experiences at my job that I recently quit.

I am an ICU nurse with multiple years of experience and multiple specialized certifications. I’ve worked at this particular hospital for 3+ years. When Covid hit, a few of us from each ICU (very large hospital, we have 6 ICU’s) staffed the first covid unit. I personally only had 4 days off in March 2020 and 5 days off in April 2020. 13+ hour shifts, double our normal patient work load, no PPE at times. I had a few coworkers become hospitalized with covid; a few died. But we worked our ass’ off because it was a once in a lifetime pandemic and patients needed us.

Fast forward to October 2021. Our covid numbers had finally stabilized, but I was not allowed to return to my original ICU where I worked for 1.5 years and got my specializations in because “that position has been filled since you left it voluntarily.”

The hospital cut RN pay in October due to “rising healthcare costs across the sector,” so now some ICU nurses are risking their lives at work for $23.50 an hour. Most of the remaining staff that hasn’t quit yet, quit after the announcement. Our unit needs 60 full time RN’s. At the time of the announced pay cut, they had 45, only 7 of which were actual employees. The rest were all contract. The contractors get paid $85 an hour. The staff gets paid base rate of $23.50 an hour. The staff is also responsible for being the charge nurse every shift because the contractors can’t. 

They cut pay so they couldn’t attract new contractors OR staff, so I was having to be the charge nurse every shift I worked, as well as take multiple critically ill patients myself. On top of that, our staff dropped so low, the last two months have consisted of me being the only staff member in the unit on most nights I worked. So now I’ve had to take on the role of charge nurse, take my own two critically ill patients as a staff nurse, and since i was the only staff member, i had to help everyone else learn the equipment, doctors, medicines, phone numbers, policies, as well as take every patient to CT/MRI that needed one, and make sure the unit was stocked with supplies.

I had to admit every single patient because no one else even knew where the ER was, let alone what we had to do to admit someone. Every equipment failure, every bag of blood we have to run down to get, every lab sample we had to run, I’ve been having to do it all. On top of that, two of my former coworkers now have permanent health issues from catching Covid at the hospital due to lack of adequate PPE. I have been struggling with PTSD from the first wave of Covid, when I lost over 20 of my own patients in a month.

I asked for a raise from $26/hr (my current rate) to $30/hr. I was the only full time staff member left besides the two supervisors.

I was denied and told “nurses can’t make that much.” 

I should also mention my manager actively told us not to submit safety violations because it created “too much paperwork for me.” 

After a week of negotiations, I quit. I’ve never been happier with my decision.",12/11/21 7:38

Also, I am ESL so apologies for any bad grammar.

I work in Marketing, 6+ years of experience in a very niche field. Worked for the same large company for most of that time. I have a reputation amongst colleagues as a hard working, innovative, resourceful, team player who always excels, yet I was significantly underpaid for years. Really I was miserable but afraid to leave because imposter syndrome.

However, I was doing so well that last year I was given the chance to join a program within the company, that took me away from my regular job for a few weeks to learn new skills, and make additional contributions. If I did well enough, I was told there could be a permanent spot for me on this team. While I was there, there were some organizational changes on my old team that left a possibility for me to lead them and earn significantly more money. Throughout this time I was in communication with my old VP who said that she thought I would be a good match, going as far as formally interviewing me 3 weeks before the temporary project was due to be over.

Once this project was over, I was told they were impressed with me and given the choice to stay on the team or go back. I spoke to my old VP who said it was up to me but that she really wanted me to return and ""lead the charge"". So, since I enjoyed my old job much more and saw more job security there, I returned to my old team...

You guessed it, after a few weeks I was told there would be no promotion. She instead hired her friend.

Two months later, I was offered a job somewhere else making 30% more salary plus bonuses. I went to my VP and said ""if you will match it, or come close, I'll stay"" (that was dumb of me, I know). She said ""I can offer you 5% and I'm not even sure of that. I don't like counter offers."" So I left, and within a few weeks so did everyone else that was on that team.

She did me a favor. Within 6 months, I have almost tripled my salary (switched jobs a second time), make even more in bonuses and work less hours with very little stress. Plus, my new company and bosses are amazing.

I Just Wanted Freedom,14,rdry2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdry2s/i_just_wanted_freedom/,1,1639198319,"I recently quit my job.

I am moving out of state and didn't feel the need to give a 2 week's notice since I'm an At-Will employee and owe no one an explanation for my life decisions.

I also trust in businesses to ""figure it out"" in my absence, as it is their job to hire and fire people, not force them to stay.

Additional to moving soon, I just didn't want to be there anymore. And knew I could make money other ways.

It was frustrating. Sometimes I was drowning in work to the point that I needed back up and got none. Other days there were too many people trying to do my job and we were practically fighting over things to do. The workload was either too much or too little, and you were either not relieved for a break on fast days, or the boss would try and micromanage you when even they had nothing to do because the workload was too small. On days like that, you were just supposed to ""look like"" you had a lot to do to avoid being micromanaged. And sometimes, if the managers didn't wanna do something, you'd have to go out of your zone and do fun little side projects like, ""lifting stuff way beyond my wight limit"", ""cleaning out ovens while they are on"" or ""other dangerous activities"". Fun stuff!

I pretty much didn't want that stuff to happen to me anymore. I'd already seen enough injuries to know I wasn't even safe on a slow day.

And why was it slow, you ask? Because so many people quit and we had to close breakfast and lunch.

The next day, I COULD NOT go in. I mentally could not. And that's how I knew it was my last day. I didn't want to quit over text because I pride myself on being somewhat professional, so I did the next best thing. I wrote up a letter and attached it to my text (well, I had to take a screenshot of it because it didn't work, but the effort was there) and I turned it in an hour-30 mins before my shift, blocked all my bosses immediately, and never heard from anyone again, because I literally didn't want or need to. Yes, I ghosted them.

They never saw it comin'.

And it's not that I wanted to hurt them intentionally, but sometimes you gotta do what's best for you and gtfo NOW, without begging for forgiveness or getting scorned after the fact.

I feel so much better mentally and physically since leaving. Doing gig work now (which I set up before quitting), spending so much time with my Hubs, and finally getting to prepare for the holidays and my big move!

My coworkers story.,6,rdrtbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdrtbx/my_coworkers_story/,0,1639197860,"I will admit. I love my job and have no major issues these days other than the usual getting paid less than I think I should, especially when seeing the executive compensations.  This post is about two of my co workers. 

I work as an in plant engineer for a major automotive supplier.  Up until a few years ago we had a forging engineering manager and a machining engineering manager.  A few years ago the powers that be brought in a new guy to replace them both.  I have no major issues with him.  He’s young yes, has minimal practical experience yes, had no experience managing a team, yes.  Regardless off all that he has really come a long way and I support him as my boss.  It took a few years to figure out how to be a manager because you can’t learn that in school but he figured it out.  And even with his lack of practical experience he doesn’t pretend to be smarter than everyone and knows that his strength lies in his team’s knowledge and skills.  I really do like him.  

Back to my coworkers.  We recently lost a large product line and as a result our sales didn’t justify the size and salaries of the entire engineering team. The companies solution was to let go both the prior managers (who had 40+ and 20+ years with the company respectively). I’m pretty sure this was purely a financial decision and nothing else.  I would guess that these two were making at least double what anyone else in engineering was. They lost their manager titles but didn’t take pay cuts.  My problem with the situation was the fact that we lost some really vital knowledge and skills.  The prior forging engineering manager was more vital than anyone else in our department. Even after the demotion he was still the one doing all the actual work.  He had two guys under him and one was basically a glorified maintenance guy.  The other one is a good engineer but never actually got to learn what he needed to know.  Now we have one forging engineer that will have to bust his ass and probably fuck up a lot of shit in the process to keep up with the work.  

The other prior manager who ran my side (machining) was one of the smartest guys I’ve ever met.  He wasn’t as vital as the forging guy as we have a larger and well qualified team but still he was the guy we all went to that could solve any problem.  When he was demoted the new boss basically relegated him to bitch work.  He was doing the kind of shit we usually make our interns do.  It’s sucks that he’s gone but it won’t hurt us as much as losing our lead forging engineer. 

Point of the story is how frustrating it is to see decisions based solely on a short term financial basis.  We lost the two highest paid engineers we had because that’s how we could cut the most costs with the smallest affect on man hours.  Losing our lead forging engineer is going to fuck us.  Maybe not right away but I guarantee a year from now losing him will cost more than they saved. Losing our lead machining engineer hurts but I’ll be honest and admit he kinda checked out after getting demoted.  Now issues are going to come up and we are going to waste money and time reaching for outside help. 

What pisses me off the most is the fact that I could easily identify half a dozen people on salary staff who are completely useless and don’t deserve the job or wages they get.  We have a QE (quality engineer) that corporate loves because she recently got her phd.  She makes more than all of us and is completely useless.  She is Korean (I think, not racist just don’t care) and can’t speak English to save her life despite the fact that she has lived in the States since childhood.  (On a strange side note I had a coworker who briefly dated her and claims she speaks perfect English outside of work). For example, I have a habit of immediately deleting any emails I receive from her because they are either completely unintelligible or just stupid and wrong.  I have even admitted this to my boss and he completely agrees with me ignoring her.

Toei strikes Youtuber,3,rdrmwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdrmwn/toei_strikes_youtuber/,0,1639197258,"Hello, fellows.

A Youtuber, named TotallyNotMark, who reviews anime and manga, was copyright claimed by videos that fell under Fair Use, resulting in the blocking of over [150 videos](https://youtu.be/WaeqXWzaizY).

Toei is infamous for blocking Fair Use content left and right, and, just because they have money, they have gotten away with it for too long. YouTube has also been awfully unhelpful dealing with this situation. This is nothing out of the ordinary for both companies, but doing it on this scale, leaving Mark's small company without any money, especially on Christmas.

By no means am I saying we should donate, but we should stop supporting Toei's future works (DBS movie coming out next year) and all their content coming from Japan. It's fucked. I love DBZ as much as the next guy, but this is not the first time this happens, and it's getting out of hand.

Mark posted an update regarding how futile YouTube has been, and how they suggest to get a channel manager that he has to pay for, but he can't get that, either. It's so fucked when big corporations can do anything without repercussions. [See here.](https://youtu.be/WAuWk8POxSQ)

[Soldiers of Pole](https://soldiersofpole.com/about/)

I don’t think there is enough of a push to support sex workers/strippers, so here’s a snippet of why non swers should care more:

My partner of several years has been employed as a stripper for 9 months now, and it’s incredibly frustrating what she’s had to deal with.

First of all, her employment is considered “independent contractor”- which is not entirely legal and a way for club owners to avoid providing any sort of benefits.

So, her full time job has NO benefits. Recently she suffered a tissue infection in her right knee, putting her out of work for 2 weeks. Not only does she have no support from her workplace, the injury was probably related to the fact that cleaning/small maintenance of  the stage is left for the girls to do. She has never seen anyone except fellow dancers actually clean the stage.

Also, some clubs will fire you for not showing up every week regardless of your situation, such as an injury. Some will also fire you for working at more than one club. She has had friends be blacklisted for breaking this rule. 

Owners/managers pull a lot of other bullshit. They can take your tips, a chunk of your dances sold, and set house fees where you pay to be able to show up to work basically. She has seen a manager snatch away a dancers purse because she couldn’t meet the house fee. 

Another reason union organization would be beneficial is that it can get very competitive and cutthroat among girls working in the same club. The environment does little to encourage solidarity. 

So many fucked up things go on in this line of work. My partner has so many stories I’ve probably forgotten most of them already. 

My partner loves to dance. Being on the pole is so empowering for her, it’s her outlet. But because of a simple injury, she’s dipping into the last of her savings to pay rent. It is entirely unfair to strippers and sex workers to have to live month to month- or even week to week- on uncertain wages. 

Please share this and other resource with any stripper friends you have. It is so needed.",12/11/21 6:21

Get-Paid-What-You-Will,7,rdr7xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdr7xw/getpaidwhatyouwill/,12,1639195846,"I've worked in the ticketing industry for almost two decades (event ticket, movie ticketing, etc) and one model that is frequently used is the Pay-What-You-Will model where you offer your patrons a sliding scale price to pay for the event. There is no hierarchy in terms of value, every patrons gets the same chance at the same seats, but it creates an accessible environment where more people are able to access the thing. And, from a business sense, we'd rather have the $5 than $0 if they can't pay $10.

If you flip this over, and apply it to hiring, a company could really gain some clout right now if they employed a Get-Paid-What-You-Will model, where upon interviewing, the applicant explains how much salary they feel they need to live a comfortable life, free from financial stress. And then that is the salary they get.

At first glance, the instinct here is to assume almost everyone will ask for so much salary that there's no way a business could withstand it, but if it played out like Pay-What-You-Will ticket pricing has over the years, the vast majority of people would come up with a wage that was fair.

Then, each year at raise time, the employee gets to choose their new rate based on their own performance. Again, you'd be surprised at the modesty of the amounts of these self-raises.

This is of course based on anecdotal observation and reporting from one perspective, but it's certainly true that giving autonomy to people to value their own self worth both allows them to feel like they are being treated fairly and helps breed a culture of trust between an employer and employee.

Lastly, let me say that I, myself, am classically anti-work and believe in a future where we don't have to slave away every day just to meet our basic needs, but there are plenty of people who WANT to work, and innovative ideas in hiring and managing are needed to help support them.",12/11/21 6:10

I work around 2-3 hours a week and have neither gotten into grad school, nor been hired full time, nor been able to get freelance work more than once in a blue moon. I live with my parents and they said they'd never kick me out or make me pay rent. I have no driver's license. I hardly pay for anything and live a middle class lifestyle. I'm also not looking to date. I've been pressured by multiple people to apply for SSI, but don't want to even try to enter into that hellhole. DOR has been useless.

I go back and forth on how I feel about mooching off my parents with no end in sight. On one hand, I feel like a worthless, unaccomplished piece of shit who so far hasn't amounted to what people anticipated I would and like I live in a void with no intellectual outlet, but on the other, I feel grateful to have such a supportive family that I largely get along with, and don't like any of the traditional options which have been advertised to me so far.

I've known for a while that I don't like the idea of having a boss or being massively indebted to some investor like a record label in the long run and having to constantly be in service of other people's dreams and ideas. I also have never worked super well with other people and am not sure what my stamina would be for a 40+ hour work week given how poorly I sometimes handle stress.

The most attractive-sounding thing to me at the moment is to have my own business which revolves around my own skills and interests, but I'm scared that in order to do really well, that I'd have to be super predatory and ruthlessly step on everybody in order to come out on top. It seems like the most successful, lucrative business owners all lack integrity and a moral compass one way or another.

Advice on Employer Reviews?,4,rdqy2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdqy2o/advice_on_employer_reviews/,1,1639194943,"I’ve learned from contacting a lawyer that it is possible to end up defending a lawsuit if you make negative public or written statements about a business. The business does not have to be right about the statements to file a lawsuit and you could have significant legal expenses even if the case ends up being dismissed.

Also, there’s nothing that absolutely protects someone’s anonymity. Although it’s rare, courts can rule that job websites have to comply with subpoenas issued by a grand jury and legally required to share information related to a user’s identity. 

If anyone has any further information or loopholes to sharing shitty employer reviews without reprisals, please feel free to comment.

I originally got into this job due to the higher pay at $15 and some change. I am a flexrt worker for a fulfillment center GS01, so I ""choose when I work""

First off the hiring process is complete bullshit. I applied for the position that would let me drive the forklift and other equipment, but instead was made to do the grueling job of sorting and stowing packages. Having to do a job that you weren't applying for seems like commonplace, so one should expect this sort of thing, however my dumb self really wanted to drive a forklift. That and the fact that the pay I was told I would get for the applied position was $17 and some change. 

Now onto my shift type, flexrt. Advertised as you choose your hours is bullshit. Shifts are split into 4 sections of a day. 2 morning/afternoon shifts and 2 night/overnight shifts. As a part time worker (again I applied for a full time shift) I have a 30 hour minimum requirement for each week. At this point in time I have settled to work every morning from 7:30 to 12:15. A short shift that best helps my physical and mental health. The issue I have run into with this is the fact that 98% I do not get this schedule. The concept of ""choose when you work"" is more ""first come first serve"" where the shifts are taken faster than the newest gen console by scalper bots. And it's even more dumb with the number of flexrt workers in my section of the building is below 10. It's gotten to the point that even when I have the app open and refreshed at 6:00pm, the time new schedules come up each Friday, I'm very limited with my options from Monday being nonexistent, stuck working overnight shifts, which I have trouble working due to the stress of waiting for the time to go to work where I can't get anything done out of fear of getting too into the task and missing work entirely. (Not sure if it's and autism or anxiety thing specifically)

I've almost lost my job for getting a flat tire and not being able to make it to work, but you have no one to talk to explain you aren't able to come in. I've also had to give myself an infraction and run risk of being fired due to leaving early because I wasn't physically capable of working anymore. Went to amcare, my manager, and then hr and no one could do shit that could let me go home without issue. That and peak season means no vacation or leave of absence. 

I'm just at a loss rn. I honestly want to leave my job, it's unhealthy physically and mentally, I have no idea if anything can be done, and I'm just frustrated. I have worked at this location longer than a good majority of other workers yet I am still treated poorly. I feel trapped in this job due to how hard it is to find a new job.

So, I work for an airline handling company out of TPA. Basically, we are contractors for airlines who do ticketing, boarding, etc. in the airline uniform, but since we are contractors, we have lower pay and no airline benefits. This evening, my supervisor texted a groupchat of the employees that the client, the airline, is requesting that the employees go to Orlando to continue training and shadowing the contractors for the airline that has already resumed service at MCO, tomorrow, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, all in formal business attire that many of us do not even have (with the expectation that we have to pay for the suits, ties, etc.).

Here’s the kicker: when one of the employees texted the groupchat about their concerns about the cost of driving from TPA to MCO, like tolls, gas, parking etc., the supervisor said that we will have to absorb those costs ourselves and that we are “paid to work, not to travel.” When the employee responded by saying, imo rightfully, “we should be reimbursed for for current IRS mileage rates to cover miles and gas” for the round trip, the supervisor said, “you all chose this job and if you don’t like it I will accept your resignation. This training is not up for debate.” 


I plan on meeting with the station manager (the supervisor’s boss) tomorrow to discuss this and other incidents with this manager and I wanted to know how I should discuss this with them. Is what the supervisor is demanding even legal?

EDIT 1: We are employees for the company, not contractors. We all have W2s and W4s. The company is contracted to do the work for the airline.",12/11/21 5:49

They made my work 8 hours in the field selling and 2-3 hours training before and after the day. Doing creepy rituals and mock sales. They make you work for free and tell you that you can open your own branch in a year making 6 figures. Each branch is a separate entity and they constantly close and reopen under different names to avoid legal action and bad press. I lasted a month until I found this amazing website.

Before anti work, this person chronicled every renaming they could find and got users adding more. It helped me realized I was working for a borderline cult. Here's a snippet that I hope helps someone who might be secretly working for a Devil Corp entity:



DS-MAX, Smart Circle, Cydcor, Innovage, Granton, Quantum, The Landers Group, Cobra Group, PerDM, Credico, Appco Group, Optimo International, Socio Max, etc., are the exact same company.  They all have the same system, run the same scam, and are owned by the same people.  They all have a “management training program”, incorporate their managers in order to avoid lawsuits, post misleading advertisements on career websites, and lie and cheat like it’s going out of style.  Having all these names is the only way to keep their racket alive because it makes it harder for people to find out who they’re working for. 

Just think about it.  Why do they have so many names?  If they were doing good deeds, they wouldn’t need to hide within their nested spheres of deception and duplicity.  If they were doing the right thing, they would gather their entire organization under one banner and proudly advertise themselves to the world.  Instead, they change names like people change underwear and continue their fraud with different identities so new employees don’t know who they’re working for. 


TOP TEN SIGNS YOU ARE WORKING FOR DEVIL CORP
#10 You’ve been employed by your company for four months and it’s changed its name more than once.

#9 You tell relatives and acquaintances you’re working on an “advertising campaign” but you’re really selling products door-to-door, inside of major retailers, collecting for charity, or hustling junk in a box on street corners.

#8 You have to go to the office every morning and participate in cult-like rituals meant to brainwash you on their business. You work twelve hours a day, six days a week and spend all your free time with co-workers.

#7 Your management training involves you buying lunch for new recruits.  You realize you’re not a manager nor are you participating in any management training.  You believe you’re only “in the field” in order to get your own office.

#6 You look down on “9-5 schmucks” who have secretaries that make more than you and your entire team combined.

#5 You espouse the principles and theories of the most successful people on earth who would absolutely be repulsed by the business you’re in. 

#4 You work 70+ hours a week but quietly borrow money from your sixteen year old neighbor who works at McDonald’s.  

#3 You eat fast food more than ten times a week or can’t afford to eat out at all.

#2 You live in a two bedroom apartment with 6 co-workers and one of them is your boss.

#1 You work for an organization that has in just three decades screwed more than a million people while only the select few at the top of the pyramid have actually made any real money. 

If you can say yes to any of these signs, you should probably run.",12/11/21 5:30

I was paying $80 dollars biweekly for insurance and $75 dollar copay for an office visit to my cardiologist. Had to go every 6 months. Check the healthcare.gov to look for options after I lost my job to get my meds refilled. Cheapest option for me was $290 a month with a $8900 deductible before they would even cover half the cost for me to see a specialist. I scrolled through a lot of the options until I found one that would cover even a fraction of the cost for me to see my regular doctor, most would not even pay for my existing care giver. The cost was well over $400 dollars to even sign up plus what and office visit would cost. I am out of work so that would really cause me some problems. I was like ""fuck it"", then I called my doctors office to see how much it would cost me to just pay it myself. They originally said $330 dollars unless they want to do an EKG, and if not we can reimburse you for the EKG cost. That option was a lot cheaper then paying for insurance while unemployed. It actually seemed cheap so I told her again I was paying myself without insurance. She said I might qualify for a discount. She said I did. Private pay is $190 with an EKG if they don't give me and EKG they will refund me the cost of and EKG after I pay. So I was a bit confused so I asked if the $190 was along with the $330. She said $190 was the personal pay discount with an EKG, if they didn't do an EKG I would be refunded $35.

Ok, let's stop with the job-hopping debate.

If you're switching jobs because you are:
❌underpaid
❌bored
❌disrespected
❌overworked
❌unappreciated
❌want better for yourself

That is not job-hopping. That's called not settling.

( I really don't like the term job-hopping, I think it's gaslighting but that's another post I'll make.)

If you know what you want & refuse to sacrifice your expectations just to say you have a job, hop away friend. 

The only way ""job-hopping"" can backfire is if you have no clarity on what you're looking for & crossing your fingers hoping to find what you want. 

I think you need to be strategic & intentional.

BUT if you have a plan & know what you are trying to obtain it can work out in your favor. 

Over are the days of rotting away in a job you hate. 

Over are the days of using ""gratefulness"" to cover up your misery.

I guess we will all be some rabbits 🐰🐰😂because I am hopping away from anything that doesn't serve me. 

You deserve better. Stop apologizing for it.

I'd spoken to my co-workers who were full-time and they stated that's how they were hired on as full-time with benefits. cue covid happening and the company to place a hiring freeze. My contract changed to month to month, and once this occurred I decided to start applying to other positions. 

The day came when my manager hit us up saying they would not renew our contract but he'd help us out with our resume's and give a letter of recommendation to all of us contractors. After being laid off, I found another job, and this is the job in question that forced us to turn on our cameras.

Little to my knowledge, this company was an MSP(basically outsourced help desk). I didn't know this at the time of hire that I'd have to take calls and assist user's troubleshoot their issue. This was a lower tier position below my skill set. In my first week, meeting with my manager, he'd stated our camera's had to be on, and I hated this, but i complied because i needed the job. The same week, I had started my new position was the same week i started looking for work else where.

Fast forward a month later, and I'm hired at my dream job(i know.. i know.. there is no such thing as a dream job, but if i have to work, might as well have a favorable one, right?).  This was the exact position I was looking for at a pretty good company in my favorite industry. We had a team meeting at the MSP job, and a couple of us had our camera's off. My manager gets pissy and says ""if you don't have your camera's on, it's a write up and eventual termination. If you don't like it, feel free to leave"". Me knowing I already had secured the other position with an offer letter and such, I respond with ""okay. Consider this my two weeks notice"". 

If you guys had seen the face he made oh my dear lord lmfaoo. He just responded with ""well wait, lets talk about this after this meeting in private"".  yeah, what ever he said didn't get me to change my mind. I'm still here at my new position and I'm honestly loving it. I get to learn new things every day from people much smarter than me, and it's exactly what I'd want to do if I had to work. I'm still very much anti-work but to pay the bills, this isn't new position isn't so bad. 


TL:DR - Get bamboozled into a position that was below my skill-set, manager says if you don't like to turn on your camera's, feel free to leave, and so i did",12/11/21 5:19

My old Camp boss and Why I quit,2,rdq74f,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdq74f/my_old_camp_boss_and_why_i_quit/,0,1639192469,"So it's a long story of one of my previous places of work a little while ago. 

I worked at a beach summer camp/marine science education camp that was run out of a small building (this was before the virus).  It was a very small company and I've worked previously for various camp positions all the way up to director for about 12-15 years or so.  For this camp I acted as an on-site director as well as multi-media manager/producer and had started the october before the virus in the U.S.  

Then the virus came and we shut down for a couple of weeks as we assessed the situation.  This is when things started to go... Crazy.  We lost the office so the business moved into boss's home and we converted it.  We opened arguably way too soon with not nearly enough covid-safety protocols.  We even had a family she let through who ALL had it and then didn't tell us.  I found out from a coworker working that specific camp WAY later and was never told by the boss.

 She would call us and tell us sometimes the morning of a camp that we had to go to work without checking out availability (camps were not overnight and just based out of different beaches).  Some paychecks were not getting to us and I was being paid 12 an hour.  My only job.  And I might've been the highest paid person there.  She would get upset if we disclosed money info with the coworkers.  But none of it was a big deal cause I love childcare and was in it for the kids and a nice easy beach job that I was good at.  Getting kids to have fun while being safe.  (Which I might add was never good enough for her if we missed a tiny thing to do that day from her 'list' which was more concerned about knowing what we were doing every second and where all the equipment was.  Since we were understaffed severely I had to keep track of everything, watch the kids and staff, plan the day, teach any lessons, watch safety, and I drove the equipment to and from location, dealt with parents, did attendance and more IN ADDITION to my media job. ) 

To clarify as well at this point we were a skeleton crew at every location.  3 people (2 adults) to take care of up to 20 kids (not too hard normally) but at a beach.  An adult always had to be present, we also had to be in the water watching ALL of them and making sure they didn't disappear.  All while I had so many other duties.  And we still didn't go one day without some complaint from either overprotective parents who stayed to watch (seriously why send your kids to a camp).  Or from my boss who would be mad over tiny things like doing a game differently or skipping a lesson for a different one the kids would want to hear.  She was VERY micromanaging.

And then the shjt storm hit.  One morning I had fallen a bit ill from food poisoning.  So she had me still go and take attendance for the camp that morning and let me go home.  However instead of sending someone or having herself cover for me as a director... Y'know having a good adult there... She left the watch and care of the kids to my counselor and junior counselor.  They then proceeded to be FIRED when they took the kids off camp grounds to go pick up some food and go watch a movie at the junior counselor's house.  Just the WORST idea.  They were caught when the JC's parents got an alert from their door camera.  

Bad idea and I felt a bit bad since I couldn't be there to have stopped that.  BUT the reason I quit came up because of this.  The counselor was upset at my boss and started telling her that we complained all the time about her and the money and the details of the job.  The counselor basically told her all the issues we had with her... Except I was still working for her.  So I get into the office the next day and learn all this, and it sends me into shock by her yelling at me for a while, then she says she wants to see all the messages we had been sending.  I was an idiot and in shock over finding out and handed my phone to her.  (Now mind you there was nothing illegal on there at all.  The only things she wouldn't have liked were us discussing pay and complaining about how uptight the environment was but also lax COVID safety rules and minor complaints about what had happened.  Y'know, talking shop.

She proceeds to fire two more people on the spot.  I feel horrible because I basically got them fired and I should've just held on to my phone and got fired myself.  She tells me 'im on thin ice and lucky she needs the help' and sends me home.  

I immediately started looking for a new job and one month later I quit.  I know there could've been some legal actions I might've looked into but the place was a nightmare I'm glad to be distanced from.  Also there's no good documentation of the bad stuff.  

As far as I know the business went under (no money which she never told us in time anyways) and everyone I know lost their job there.  Then she resurfaced and is still doing the job.  But I'm staying far away.  I spent over a decade of my life being a very successful child care professional and how she runs her business is just ... Wrong. 

I wish I had a tldr for this but it's just too much to summarize. 

 Anyways I'll field any questions or clarifications I can cause I know I must've missed or not explained correctly.",12/11/21 5:14

We get paid 60k a year. I did logistics she did assembly.  We also do on boarding and job placement. She request a raise they said no, so she left. now they hired one person for 60k to do onboarding and just posted a job for 80k just for the training assembly portion.

I then go to my boss and tell them I should receive this much since I still do both and now y’all split up the last job into two positions. My boss counters with some bs promotion in place and 3 grand raise and then maybe the amount of money the new assembly training position is. After taxes and insurance..that’s is under 50 dollars extra a month. 

They could have just gave my coworker ten grand hell twenty grand raise and she would have stayed but no and now they are paying two people or if you will….paying 140k to do the job that they were paying someone just to do for 60k. It’s insane they pushed out a good employee and they did it again.  

They couldn’t justify why all of a sudden half the amount of work is consider such a high paying job. But mine is still the same.

The whole thing is another company offered me 80k yearly with it provided as needed….100k in stock. I was going to turn that down Bc I thought my job cared about me.

it must have been fate Bc the day that job was posted for twenty grand more than mine, that company called and said I passed and offered me the position.

Today was day 3 of my new career with a very well known and highly desirable company to work for. Day 1 and 2 are my normal benefits briefings, hr paperwork etc. I was doing orientation with other new hires as well, however majority of the briefings didn't apply to me because of my position(alittle higher up and classified in nature) so alot of my questions were not able to be answered. 
Day 3, I meet my supervisor at 645am. A simple shake of the hand and exchange of greetings. 
12pm I ask a coworker to show me to the supervisors office to discuss a schedule issue. The schedule in my contract doesn't match what I'm being told I am working. 
I mean vastly different. I bring this to said supervisor of whom I met 4 hours ago for 2 minutes.
 He proceeds to tell me I don't have time for this today! I'm wrong, he interviewed me and he doesn't make mistakes. We exchange a few more comments, all peaceful. I proceeded to hr to figure out the schedule issue because he seemed very incompetent and the furthest thing from credible information. Hr takes a copy of my contract fwds it to employee relations. 
I then proceed back to the supervisor to show him the contract in writing. I hand it to him and he states what the f*** is this supposed to mean to me? Along with a few more jabs. I then told him him how disrespectful and unprofessional he is all while he laughs at me and mutters the same thing back as if he's surprised someone finally told him.. I attempted to retrieve my contract from him which he tried to take from me and keep it from me after I told him hr has been notified regarding the shift issue. I suspect because this is the only proof I had of anything, I walked away and this gentleman followed me more then 1000 feet harassing me on camera about contacting hr. We exchanged more pleasantries in the stairwell where he proceeded to ""fire me"" and take my badge.

5 hours later, after contacting hr, security camera footage is being pulled and I am being paid without going to work till the conclusion of the investigation. Hr stated, supervisors do not have firing authority, and he broke numerous security protocols. 
They also referenced discrimination.

Any advice? They genuinely seem very worried I'm going to take this further. Corporate hr called me after hours, to state I am an employee. I am being paid. I am not expected to go to work, my time card will be filled out and asked I be patient while this is handled. I told them I am speaking to the eeoc  and an attorney seeking options, but only seeking at the moment and how I handle this is dictated by how they do.

It seems to me that if AI perform as we believe them to be capable of, that at this very moment, we are writing the data and story that will form some of the basis for it's intelligence and behavior, when one inevitably gets loosed on the internet. Or even created as part of a training exercise in black box, fed large unselected data sets to see what happens. 

It seems like this is a battle of titans unfolding before me, gestalt beings of light flitting this way and that as they integrate with each other, waves of color spreading through limbs and nodes as different ideologies literally struggle it out.

But I figured I'd throw in my story cause it fits here. 

I do installs at a SaaS firm. Software is garbage and for 2 years I was the only one who could figure out enough work arounds for successful go-lives. Once this was apparent, I was pulled in every direction to put out every fire. Didn't mind, I enjoyed the work. But why am I getting paid the same as the others in my position who's messes I'm constantly cleaning? 
 
So I'm promised a promotion with a decent bump from 50 to 65k and a middle management title, was all I wanted and easily deserved. They say we're working on it, we're waiting on these numbers, we need to move things around, blah blah...I see it's just going no where. So I start interviewing. I make it known that I am, they can't fire me or they'll have no launches. Then all the sudden guess what! It's approved! Great. I tell my interviewers to kick rocks, I never really wanted to leave the job I was so damn good at. 
 
Surprise surprise, back to the red tape and excuses. Now I'm pissed, I've could have had that salary by now with one of those jobs, so I go back to interviewing. Within a few weeks I'm hired at another SaaS firm, at that 65k mark. Awesome, nothing more rewarding then turning in a resignation letter at a place that's wronged you.
 
Interesting part here - less than 24 fucking hours from the point I turned that in, I had a written offer on my fuckin desk, for $15k more than what I asked. Are you fucking kidding me, all this bullshit about red tape and you could have had it done within a fucking day. Keep your fucking money, I'm broke but I have some pride. I was so offended by that and made that clear. Should have just said thanks and goodbye, would have been much better terms. 
 
Anyway, fast forward a few months and I'm damn miserable at the new job. It's healthcare related, and what a complete fucking nightmare. There is a reason that shit is so expensive and anyone in that biz can attest to the fucking pork. Won't go too far into that, but the director at my old job quit, so they reached out to me to fill the spot, even higher salary doing exactly what I was doing before. They screwed me but it saved me from the healthcare job. 
 
So now I'm back, and I'm technically the bad guy with this sub (mid-management). BUT to my credit I've never denied PTO (cause that's fucked) and when they need the time and had training/customer obligations, I handle it for them, because that's my role.   
 
They have pissed me off once since I've been back. C-Level pulled me aside to thank me for coming back. I explained how insulted I was with the circumstances of me leaving. She said the offer was going to come that week either way and it was just ""bad timing"". That was a lie, and an obvious one. I just said ""okay"", and left. Raised all those feelings again. But I'm fine now, like my job and love my team.

Job searching on the clock,17,rdpkoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdpkoi/job_searching_on_the_clock/,0,1639190454,"I'm very proud of my partner lately, here's why. 

She was laid off in 0ctober 2020 ""due to COVID setbacks at her company."" I put that in quotes because, well, we don't believe them. She spent about 6 or 8 months looking for a good fit and collecting unemployment and stimulus benefits, as we were fine as I also have a good job (engineer). Finally she started to feel like she just needed a job so she took a job she doesn't care about and is unlikely to advance her career in any way. The pay is good, slightly less than her previous job, but more than I make and more than mostly of our friends and family make. 

However, within a few weeks here she decided wow, this job is trash. So for the last several months she has been doing the bare minimum, meetings etc for her job while spending the majority of her weekday hours interviewing for other jobs that actually suit her resume and that will pay her what she's worth (she's got almost 15 years in her very specialized industry, she's rare and worth a lot). She's had several final interviews for >6 figure jobs and I'm confident she will land one, but I'm just so stoked that she's been able to basically blow this job off because the company sucks and they're under paying her for her time. 

I'll also add that earlier this summer, she accepted a role at another company, and after they mailed her her laptop and other supplies, she sent them back and declined the job because she ""just wasn't into it."" 

I know it's hard to get what you feel like you deserve, but this woman is out there pushing hard to be appreciated and respected for her achievements by an employer, and I admire that shit so much.",12/11/21 4:40

I had already put my 2 weeks in to end employment on the 18th, but I got sick on Monday so I haven’t been working recently. 

I’m set to go back tomorrow, but I noticed they were changing my schedule on me again. All they did was add a freight shift at 7 am-8 am. That makes it to where I work the freight before opening, then go back to the store to close. 

I’ve always been a cashier. I have never done a proper freight shift in my life. The one time I did was helping them unload a truck during an emergency situation. (I ranted about that in a separate post.) 

It’s only scheduled for an hour, so I’m not sure it’s actually unloading a truck, (changing signs? They’re unpredictable though) but I honestly don’t care. I’m mad they scheduled it without telling me. I would’ve missed it had I not checked from a gut feeling. 

I want to quit on the spot tomorrow so badly, but I hate confrontation and being the ‘bad guy’. 
I don’t need the job for bills or anything, so I’m really blessed in that aspect, but this is sort of my last straw.

I was recently promoted at my retail job to assistant manager. I was already working full time (45hrs/week) at this job but still couldn't afford to live off of that, so this promotion meant I was able to stop doing gigs and start having a life outside of work. A month after I quit doing gigs, my hours were decreased to 30hrs/week (so now I make the same as I made before my promotion), we have also lost our health benefits in this time (the owner forgot to renew our plan and just hasn't gotten to doing it), and I was of course given more responsibilites due to my promotion, with significantly less time to do it...all l while working a windowfront shop in the downtown core of my city.

I have about 1-2hrs each day where I don't have anyone else in the store with me. I now spend that time applying for other work. I've also since told the co-workers I get along with that I'll be gone as soon as I can find a new job so they know what's up if offered my position after I leave. Take this as your reminder that owners will do anything in their power to save money and their promises are empty as fuck.

There seems to be a time honored tradition that you have to eat shit and accept being treated like shit to advance in most work environments. It’s been in TV shows, movies, books and, of course, word of mouth for the last few generations at least. People want to know you suffered. If you didn’t you are to pay the price on the other end.

Those posting stories here and supporting those who have to deal with the assholes of most work environments are attempting to change the status quo. We went to be treated fairly and humanely whether we started today or have been there for 40 years. We want no one taken advantage of and everyone to receive a livable wage. Yet much of the push back isn’t bosses, it’s other workers who didn’t fight back and want you to suffer as they did.

Obligatory: on mobile.. pls excuse mistakes

For a while I was working as an adjunct lecturer. FYI…We are the low paid college professors that fill in the class listings and don’t have benefits such as health insurance. 

Anyway, I had children and eventually stopped signing up to teach classes to spend time with my kids. Mind you, I’m still on payroll and could re-sign up at any point because I was in good standing with student reviews & teacher observations, etc… 

I lost track of my teacher email login because they keep making you change passwords, so often I just gave up on it.  That’s where they normally reach out to me. 

They must have been desperate because I get this email some weeks ago to my personal email asking if I could teach such and such classes, and I thought about it, and figured why not? They need help and I could use the money. I could stress myself just for the one semester as a favor to them and kind of keep active in my field. 

A week after I accepted to fill the classes, I get an email that I need to interview for it. What the?! 

I figure it’s just like a meeting to meet the new dean who took over from the last time. 

I was wrong.

So after accepting the interview and 2 days before it would take place, the dean says I must prepare a lesson on a topic he specified using PowerPoint that lasts at least 15 minutes. 

I freaked out on the inside and still accepted it, but then after about an hour of freaking out about finding time on the fly (without pay), I wrote back that I was no longer available to teach.

The boss who stole Christmas,11,rdovq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdovq7/the_boss_who_stole_christmas/,11,1639188253,"This post might sound like I'm making a huge deal out of something kinda silly or petty but let me just preface this post by saying that my boss is a type A workaholic who micro manages everyone in the tech department to the point of pissing off every single one of us. She literally steam rolls over our projects and duties which is absolutely maddening. By the way, did I mention she is a project manager...? The worst type of ""career"" that was ever created to torture the rest of us. Create more work and drive everyone up the wall. 

I have put up wth her B.S. for over two years now because the pay is good and my job is union so it's kind of a no brainer. It's a difficult job and it can be highly stressful and demanding.  I'm just doing my very best. I work hard and I am dedicated. 

To get to the point, our office building decided to do a door decorating contest (optional). I wasn't even going to do it but then I spoke to a co-worker in another department and she inspired me to make something fun and creative. I decided what the hell...I'll have some with it. I drew up an idea and decided on Snoopy and Woodstock Christmas theme and the classic Charlie Brown Christmas tree. Who doesn't love those characters?! 

I was super stoked about it and spent my lunch break buying craft materials and some decorations.  I probably spent a little more than I should but most of it could be reused and extra for other projects. Whatever.  I spent at least two hours total shopping and gathering everything.  I was just having fun and being creative which my job doesn't really allow for. 

Come this morning, I load up a massive bag of Christmas door decorations and am ready to take this on first thing. I drag this massive bag up the stairs to the second floor and I just about fell over when I saw my boss way down the hall at my office space door. She was scotch taping those individually wrapped candy canes to the door in a half hazardly fashion above a ripped and rather sad piece of ugly wrapping paper.  She had essentially come in super early and threw up a bunch of cheap crap to the door. She never bothered to ASK myself or the others whether WE were doing anything and if we wanted her to do it. 

Important note: She does NOT work in the office. She is usually not even around. She typically stays at an entirely different location and floats around when there are meetings. She DOES NOT have a space in that room. I work near two other people who I asked if it were cool to take this project on and they gave me a thumbs up. I actually communicated with others and didn't just assume it was mine. 

I was so devastated and angry that I walked past her without a word and threw my stuff down near my desk. It was really obvious that I had this giant bag of decorations and I just tossed it to the floor. Right there and then, I turned around to just get away from her so I strode by her and said without looking at her 

""Go ahead. It's not like i don't spend most of *my* time in this place. Thanks for asking"". 

I walked down the hall and out the front door. I had to get away from her or else I would have just lost it. I was so upset. She doesn't consider anyone else. She just takes over. What bothers me more is that she thought throwing some horrible crap on OUR door would suffice for ""our department "". As far as I was concerned,  it was not for supervisors to do but for staff. People like myself and others to be creative and share in the fun. I felt like she just robbed me of something and took all the joy out of the holidays.  

I guess I have a lot of extra decorations for my home. I'm sure as hell not doing my project now. The moment and inspiration is long gone. She stole this from me.

Donate your money in our honor!,6,rdoto5,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdoto5/donate_your_money_in_our_honor/,5,1639188086,"Every year, my employer runs a drive through December to raise money for local charities, and send a hundred emails about it through the month letting everyone know how close we are to “our” goal. Now don’t get me wrong, charity is quite important and I’ve made donations and have volunteered for various things throughout my life.

But it hits different this year. Our union contract was up for renewal, and despite our best efforts, we got a measly 3% cost of living adjustment. Yes, I know lots of people don’t get COLAs at all. This 3% was in spite of the fact that we already knew at the time that this was less than the ~4.5% that inflation was being predicted to be, which we now know is over 6%.  This is aside from the fact that I’m already paid around 10% less than market for my position when compared to the same position in other areas with MUCH lower CPI. 

Yet this company is **still** prodding us **daily** to make donations. I really want to reply-all to one of these emails and tell **everyone** in the organization how tone-deaf it is of our employer to nickel and dime us on a COLA, resulting in what is effectively a -3% raise, then constantly pestering us about donating money to those *they* perceive to be “in need”.

Experience from a Unionized Company,13,rdorih,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdorih/experience_from_a_unionized_company/,6,1639187925,"Inspired by what I've seen on this subreddit, I wanted to offer a first-hand example of what a union can do for workers at a company.

After I graduated from college I landed a job at one of the big three car companies in Michigan, as an engineer. I wasn't in the union, but the UAW represents a large portion of the company's employees so my benefits were built largely on what the union could negotiate. The union wins $1, the engineers get $1.10.

***Day 1, here was my package:***

\-$77,000 in salary, which isn't anything extravagant but Michigan is a pretty low-cost state.

\-**3 weeks paid vacation** the day I started, with **an extra week** in December and at least **9 extra days** off sprinkled throughout the year (Labor day, voting day, the day before and after Easter, etc). Every year you get an additional week off for a maximum of **6 weeks**, NOT counting the extra week in December and other days off. 

\-**Sick days whenever I needed them**. If anyone was sick for an extended period of time there's a special program, but if I felt burned out and needed a day off I had no problem taking it. Just let send an email in the morning saying I'm not feeling good; show up the next day and no guilt, no trouble, no worries.

\-Automatic contribution to 401k of 4%, with an additional 4% match if you contribute at least 6% personally. **Essentially, an 8% contribution.** 

\-Health insurance for about $125 a month (myself and spouse). 

\-**$1,500** a year placed into my Health Savings Account (as long as a got a checkup).

\-Yearly raises of at least 2.5% but not uncommon to get **5%,** if you've done well. 

\-**Yearly bonus of around 10% of your base salary**. This varied based on how well you did and how well the company performed overall but was pretty reliable. 

Obviously the car companies are particularly wealthy entities, not everyone will be able to win this exact list, but there's no reason you can't make your workplace better.",12/11/21 3:58

Recruiters please just stop. 🛑,20,rdohfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdohfi/recruiters_please_just_stop/,5,1639187051,"
I set my Linkedin to open to work to see what’s out there and I have gotten absolutely bombarded with so much garbage. This also goes for HR/hiring. I really don’t know how much of this is recruiters doing what is mandated by their company/management but tell your bosses to stop.  

1. Put the salary in the job description or it will be ignored. Be transparent. Don’t waste my time or yours. 

2. Tell me what you can do for me. Why would I leave my current job for someone who is going to tell me everything they expect of me without giving me an idea of what they plan to do for me (in terms of benefits and career growth) Even if someone is between jobs why should they choose you when they have tons of other choices? You need to sell yourself not the other way around. There is a labor shortage and labor (especially skilled) has a ton of leverage and choices. Be straightforward with what is expected. A lot of places overdo it with inflated language on the job description when the job is pretty simple and a lot can be learned on the job. 

3. Using the word “rockstar” or pushing a company culture. No one gives a fuck. What are the salary expectation’s and benefits. The connotation with “rockstar” is underpaid and overworked.

4. Go remote or go home. Join the idea of work-life balance or GTFO of my inbox. 

5. Decent benefits. Updated to not include PTO but rather rather least a month of paid vacation, a 4 day workweek, 401k, a good health insurance policy.",12/11/21 3:44

Just feeling incredibly pissed off and gotta share the experience to see if anyone else thinks this was fucked up.

Started a new job at a car parts store in late October.  Im not a Mechanic, and I really get troubled with nonstandard stuff like farm equipment and some recreational vehicle stuff.  But I thought I was doing good.  I had some good coworkers to pick the brains of if I ever got stumped with something.  And I really enjoyed the place.  It was a business that recentley sold out and had a new owner, but some (most?) of the staff were still there.

All of a sudden as im getting ready to leave for the weekend (I was supposed to work tommorow)  my boss tells me to hang back.  and very abruptly tells me

""Thats it... I gotta let you go.   things are really on the downturn around here (Business is very slow),   you're not gonna be a good fit.   But the door is always open..""

My first reaction was to ask why.  when he just sat there silentley I asked him if it was something I did, or didnt do.  and he just said ""yeah kind of a little of both.  I know I didnt train you at all and thats on me""

So basically what he told me is.  I'm laying you off because minimum wage is increasing, we arent doing well, and i cant afford to keep you,  but im also firing you because you arent going to work out here as an employee... but the door is always open.  what the fuck does that mean?.

And no, I didnt get any training. Id get a crash course in how to use their point of sale system,  and I was shown a few things about where some stuff goes when stocking or picking.  and that was it.  anything else I had to learn from observing my coworkers.   And there was clear evidence that the old co-workers way of doing things, and the way the new boss wanted things done,  Were way off one another. I tried to please everybody, at the end of the day the boss signs the check, so I'd default to his orders.  but the thing was, he never showed me how he wanted things done. and was never around to explain or train..

I think I have stockholm syndrome.  I really liked the job, and I felt like I was getting my life on track. But I think the place might be destined for a quick death,  maybe my boss is an idiot too. I dont know., I liked everyone there.  but that was an extreme douchebag move to pull on me  


I sent him a text afterward, apologizing for just kind of walking out abruptly after our brief exchange,  I was very upset because it was a bombshell dropped on me,  and asked him if he could give me some clarification on what the reason was.  he just said he'll send me something in writing.  the 2IC who I was supposed to work with tommorow, I sent a text to, telling him that I was let go,  but he was a pleasure to work with,  told him I didnt know why.  and he suggested it was because of money..  I dont fucking know, other than that im back at square 1.",12/11/21 3:41

My boss(es) required that not only should their information be in the systems, but on a sticky note ""just in case"" the information provided ""wasn't correct""(??) and they would need to cross check with the ""Stickies"" to make sure the info was correct.

Me (and another coworker) noticed that this slowed us down... a lot. Writing in pencil/pen all this information we just put into the system... was... odd. (Yes the boss is old.)

So, we decided, well, lets just slowly stop doing them and try and transfer everyone over to using the online system, since... since working here, I don't think we've ever even referenced one sticky note? (they get thrown in the trash at the end of the month! What a waste of paper!!) 

I get called up, today, and I was told I'm fired because I don't do the stickies. There were more bullshit ""I just don't think the job is right for you..."" excuses (despite customers loving me?). She brought up the stickies on her own, claiming that as ""one of"" the reasons I was being terminated. Yet she couldn't give me any specifics when I pressed for them? Fine.

Now I have to apply for unemployment, and honestly, I'm at a loss, I've never done this before, but I know me and my wife will be fine in the long run.

My problem is that they make the hiring process either really short and you know the job is gonna suck or they make the process ridiculously long and it feels like a waste. 

For example; I've been in the hiring process with a medical company to get back in my field for a month and a half; and that's short compared to some of the others I've been through. I've got shit to do and not wait around on these companies for that kind of time. I usually end up ghosting or sending them a sugar coated fuck you by email. 

I'll find a job and in the beginning it will be alright, then slowly but surely you start noticing the cues and it's like a toxic relationship; in bloom. The thing that really gets me is that I don't care about money, I mainly want the benefits because I have meds and health issues to deal with. 

The number one thing, to me, is that quitting a job shouldn't affect my quality of life. That is an absolutely garbage way of pushing people under, who are already treading water. Quitting a job shouldn't threaten my ability to receive healthcare, I didn't ask for this shit. It shouldn't make me starve, end up turning my water, and lights, and furnace off. I don't want to be in this fucking rat race where it's work or die. 

The whole American mindset on having a job is way too ""Work will set you free"" for me. 

I have a dog, a child, a house that is still a shitshow. When I moved in here there was no heat, no bathroom, one outlet, I've had to exhaust myself to make progress and I can't do that and exhaust myself at work. I have no want for any of this anymore.",12/11/21 3:36

My GM is old school and believes that work is the most important thing you can do with your life and set up our schedules to maximize our time at the dealership with a minimum of 60 hours by alternating 10 and 12 hours days 6 days a week and only getting off the your second day if you sit down with 12 customers the week. If anyone knows what going on in the auto industry you would know that there are practically no new inventory out there and the dealership has been dead for the past 3 months.  I'm starting to break,  I'm there all the time. I have no time to take care of myself, my home, my life in general. I've been pretty vocal about how I feel and how this is ridiculous but it's always answered by ""that's just the way he is"".

I quit my last job as a business developer because I hated the company and decided to take my chances on a local small business. It's a small rural internet provider who is very competitive for the rural area. I really liked the service they were providing and loved the manager. He is a really kind honest man and a very encouraging manager. The only issue is they couldn't afford me and needed a residential (door to door rep) which I don't do. The owner and manager made me a deal that if I exceeded expectations as door to door they would have me in business to business and increase my salary to what I demanded in 6 months. I broke every record they had: daily sales, weekly sales, monthly sales everything. I won bonuses and steak dinners everything was going perfect and by 4 months I was running our entire residential service by myself (over 900 accounts) which my manager loved because it allowed him to focus on selling our new fiber coming out soon and over all took alot off his plate. 

Then today my manager told me the owner doesn't think I'm cut out for business to business and wants me to stay residential. I am 24 and have over 5 million in sales under my belt in my career I can absolutely do B2B and have done so most my life! I was so upset I told him if he can't convince the owner to honor our deal I would start looking for new work. The owner immediately called my manager and my manager told me we would come up with a ""plan"" tomorrow.

What should I do? It is clear they are negotiating in bad faith and I really don't want to change jobs because of the short time I've worked for them I feel it looks bad. They have put me in a tough spot but I know they would hurt alot without me as I am running the residential entirely solo. The manager being a good guy said he will write me an amazing letter of recommendation if I leave so I'm thinking of coming in Monday, listening to there offer, requesting my letter of recommendation and going back to work. I figure if I let them sweat it out while searching for work I will either get an amazing offer or find new work. Any advice before I go into the trenches Monday?

Edit: I also have record of there promises but they used the words ""would consider"" so I don't think I can take legal action. However I do have records of my exceptional KPI's and my 30 day review was perfect.",12/11/21 3:18

I was a caregiver at Sensations, a local long-term memory care facility. I had given up my dream position of Activities [and a marketing position] during the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic to alleviate pressure to hire (don’t get me started on that - picking and choosing candidates that are all perfectly capable and good for the job). 

Caregiving is hard, especially during COVID and when your residents actively had COVID (which they advertised the building as COVID-free and still do I believe - I don’t know, I am NOT working there anymore). We didn’t have proper gear to work with them, they made us Lysol ourselves after leaving a room, and they stopped testing us for a week because “the state of Michigan halted testing” which was very convenient since half our staff was off with the virus and they would’ve had to close if anyone else tested positive. 

What I’m trying to say is they put us through a lot. So they asked this question, which got me really excited! I chose a bonus, since partying during COVID didn’t sound appealing (even if it was just with ourselves), and I could have some extra for Christmas. So whatever. Life goes on. I don’t think about it. 

Until January, when I see a note that one of my coordinators got berating her for “telling people she got a bonus”. I haven’t told anyone until now I’ve seen this note, because I know it was wrong of me to see it in the first place (we were both in the med room and I caught the paragraph of text, the subject line was literally “Why did you tell people about your bonus?”) I’m STILL mad about it even though I left in February. I’m happy that my coordinator/friend got one but WHY did they not give everyone a bonus? I wish I had called them out. After everything they put us AND the residents through, they had the audacity to do this. It infuriates me. The way management runs the place and the quality of care the place gets infuriates me. I tried to help from the inside, I tried to report them to the state, and nothing has happened. I feel defeated and angry and I am glad there’s a place I can talk about this horrible workplace at. 

Thank you for reading so far if you have. There’s so much more I could talk about but I feel sated for the moment.

Left a new job.,20,rdnltu,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdnltu/left_a_new_job/,3,1639184403,"So, I'm a TESOL teacher here in the UK, with years of experience, I'm fully qualified, and with the pandemic coming to an end I thought I'd apply to some jobs in a physical classroom.  

I found a job pretty quickly and was excited to work back in a classroom, the salary was less than I was making online, but I thought I would take the loss of salary as I prefer teaching online. 

After being offered the job, I found out it was a zero-hours contract. This is a job that requires multiple qualifications, experience, and a degree. Additionally, I took a pay cut to be offered a mentorship scheme, which would offer me full support from a more experienced senior teacher. I quickly found out the teacher I was assigned had no relevant qualifications in my field and barely understood the industry they had worked in. I had accepted a lower pay for someone with less experience and knowledge than me to give me ""support"".

So I start the job, never the less and I'm excited to get back into the classroom. I find out pretty quickly that they only want me for one hour and a half classes once a day (The school is an hour and a half away from my house). Whatever, I miss teaching in person so I take it, being promised a pay raise and extra hours after a month. Only to show up to find out that they want me to conduct online classes from their classroom. 

A month comes by and my boss refuses to give me extra hours or a pay raise, I find out that other teachers with less experience are being paid significantly more than me. After I confronted my boss she threatens to remove my hours and calls me into a formalized meeting. I do not show up to work on the one day that there will not be an available teacher to cover for me, sending my resignation letter 5 minutes after the class had already started. Just knowing that the managers were running around like headless chickens trying to arrange an emergency cover teacher meant the world and so much more to me.

In the matrix, the plot is that humans build AI and machine learning robots that eventually overtake and destroy most all humanity- only to realize they need to keep us alive to provide them electricity. So they farm human procreation and stuff our bodies in pods and plug our minds into the matrix to keep us docile while our bodies power the machines. 


The metaverse, however is what? An escape from the very reality that we humans built. The point of the matrix was to escape the simulation, wake up the humans, defeat the robots and return to reality...  Isn't it odd that the matrix is this hellscape punishment in the film,  but like 20 yrs after the film, this metaverse is like the biggest new technological endeavor that we are eagerly headed towards 

I've seen articles that virtual 'real estate' and mansions in the metaverse are selling for millions. I also read that a couple married in the metaverse and cited cost as a reason to do it there. I guess what I'm getting at is, are they just going to enslave us there too? Should we be skeptical of this?

I got harassed for taking 2 vacations at my last job,13,rdneaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdneaq/i_got_harassed_for_taking_2_vacations_at_my_last/,4,1639183782,"I got teased and borderline harassed at my previous job for taking 2 vacations about 2 months apart from each other. The vacations weren’t even that long. I think I used 4 PTO days for the first one and 3 for the second one.

I told my manager over a month in advance about the second one. She was very reluctant but she let me have the days off. Her and the assistant manager started calling me “two vacations” and claimed I was never at work. She even “bullied me” into working every Saturday (open half the day) until my vacation which ended up being 4 or 5 of them. You got to leave early or come in late one day to off-set the hours but I still had to go to work 6 days a week. 

For reference, my old job was one where we had mandatory OT so I was working about 48+ hours a week. We had long shifts and it was a customer service/sales job where it involved walking a lot and handling sometimes rude customers. This wasn’t an easy job and vacation days were necessary. 

So the manager and assistant would constantly call me “2 vacations.” It was annoying but I laughed it off whatever. What pissed me off was the manager didn’t approve my vacation time in the system so I didn’t get paid for the days I missed. My check was hella short. I had to wait another 2 weeks for the check with the corrections. Corporate refused to mail me a check and the manager didn’t apologize and tried to blame me for it.

Side note, my manager ended up taking 2 10-day vacations in my 7 months at that location and rarely worked Saturdays and the assistant took nearly a month off work for his wedding.

 All I'm saying is there are bogus laws in place that make it impossible for what we do since we have to do it in less than two days, thanks to the lobbying of certain major companies. Yet, there are maybe 10+ contractors that we deal with each day that are looking to do work for these major companies and do as much drilling, digging and excavating for them and are willing to risk your safety.

The issues of no one wanting this job even though it protects your everyday amenities is that the pay is so piss poor and yet the contractors are able to use these laws to bypass any safety measures to start work on digging and could just cut your damned services off, one of which could kill you in an instant which is a gas line/service or even electric or worse, both. 

We need this job to be appealing to anyone that considers others safety, as these kinds of things were not buried with any thought, until recently. But mind you there is waaaaay more than you think that was buried without any thought and yet these major companies, the ones that actually buried the line or bought it, expect a ridiculous time frame to find these lines for these contractors that want to get paid as fast as possible and don't care about you or your homestead just to get paid 10-50x more than I get paid to find everything they want me to find in a scope that could be miles long with five different companies' utilities. Oh and that's just one of maybe five ""in your area.""  


TLDR: Utility locators need a massive raise for the shit they need to find and keep everyone safe due to the neglect of major companies.

As a member of capitalistic society, I feel it's my part to do the same and play by the same rules.

Especially since Covid, where many of us aren't expected to be in the office at all, my work day has totally changed. No longer do I sit in front of a computer and pretend to look busy or read epubs on my monitor since too much surfing would be frowned upon.

Some days/weeks I'm busier and have to work more, but I would say on an average 40-hour week, I work about 10 hours.  There are slow days where I wake up, log in, then roll over and go back to sleep.  I'm available by phone if anything blows up and I may respond to a couple of emails, but that may be it.

I spent years putting in as much effort as I could and going above and beyond and it was met with little to no acknowledgment. Especially in my current position. Despite gaining tons of knowledge and taking responsibility for many parts of day-to-day business, I've seen nothing but measly annual cost of living adjustments.

So as a capitalist, it's now my job to squeeze out as much profit for myself with as little effort as as possible. And so I will continue to do just that.

Hundreds of mortgage lenders and realtors. Read: executives paid millions to go to ""conference meetings"" every year to play golf, drink, or in this case to gamble. Meanwhile, you're paid the minimum.

And this life of leisure sort of simultaneously enables their conviction they must control the lives of underlings (you) and brings up a sort of primitive, less evolved sense of empathy.

You see here what happens when too many people with control freak tendencies are together at a casino. It gets to the point of brawling.

But the icing on the cake, from *The* New York *Post*:

>Police said the fight had already de-escalated by the time they arrived. No arrests were made because no one on the scene wanted to sign a criminal complaint, cops said.

Remember that they always protect their own skin and never deal with authorities. The scandals of violence that happen among themselves or among their employees is to be covered up. 

You see, they see themselves as a law unto themselves and do not see things like government regulations, morals, or laws themselves, to be laws. They're no different than an anarchist mob that sees no law as legitimate, but the Managerial Class has more destructive ways to wear down humanity than riots and arson.

&#x200B;

I have worked seasonally at a resort for the last 4 years and I have finally had it up to here \^ with the shenanigans. It's been increasingly hard to support my household during the on season (just two of us and a few pets) with what I make. This year has been especially hard with the pandalooni going on and the Canadian border being shut for most of our season (most of our business comes from Canadians). To keep workers coming back they don't fight against unemployment claims. But this year many of us didn't make enough to even qualify for it.

 Also, the ones that did are having heck getting it because the main place is getting audited by the unemployment people. Also, usually we get a very, very small bonus (60$ taxed) at the end of the year but not this year. I had no idea we didn't get it until my chef messaged me asking had I receive it and I hadn't. So, I messaged a few of my friends that work housekeeping and they did. Also, our dishwasher got two gift cards, but no bonus. Chef and I are the only ones who got squat diddly and that upset the both of us. It really isn't fair because chef was out for a lot of weeks with illness, and I had to pick up their slack and run the kitchen by myself with one cook....me. 

Yes, we only have two cooks for the entire restaurant. The managers would never let me shadow chef to learn how they did inventory their way or how to do an order (which I already knew how to do that, but they didn't need to know). There's also no creative freedom with our specials, when I did try to make something on a day they told me to make whatever I wanted. the managers complained it was ""too ethnic"" (literally just tamales and rice/beans). Being the only POC there has been super hard and I feel like some of the things I was dealing with was because they flat out didn't trust me. But towards the end they had no choice because chef was gone, breakfast shift cook was out, and no one else could do it. 

Anyways, my husband asked me not to go back and said that he would be okay with me not having a spring/summer job right away because the stress is eating at me and the whole absurdity of the place. I'm going to message the main manager and let him know I am not coming back, I just don't know how to word it.",12/11/21 2:15

I didn't have a car back there so I would take the bus which took like an hour to get there and one hour+ to get back home. It was manual labor which made me loose like ~8kg in the first month and another 4-5kg after. 

So, I would go to my normal schedule which were 8h a day but my boss obligated everyone to go for more 4h extra cuz why not? Why would they hire new ppl if they could just exploit what they had right?

So, It was in my 3rd month, I was doing extra time it was 7 p.m. so I went to the locker room and took my bag and just headed up to the bus stop. There,  me and 2 fellow workers waited for the bus, when suddenly out of nowhere 2 cars jumped us and robbed every single thing we had. It was a cold night and they even took my shirt and shoes (lol).

So, the next day I went to my boss to talk and say that I could no longer be doing the extra hours cuz I was endangering my life for a couple of bucks and it wasnt worth it and well... Guess what? He told me: ""huh? What do you mean by that? Ahahaha, that's not possible ma man, why everyone but you would have work extra? When you signed for the job they told you u would need to be up for some extra so you can't just go whenever you feel like. You owe us""

I was so upset that I remember leaving his office doors open and just went to smoke a cig during my work time.

So... 4 months had past, I was still doing the extra hours and etc and 2-3 weeks before they fired my old boss and the new one where kinda nice and everyone working there thought it would be different (we wish).

Someday, can't remember which day exactly, my best friend called. He said "" hey man, my father's not gonna make it, can you get here I need someone to talk with"" (his father had lung cancer and went to surgery that very day) and I was ""ofc bro I be right there at 5. 

So I went to my boss and told her ""hey, for personal reasons I have to go today so I'll be leaving in my regular schedule"". She sighs, looked at me with disgust and said some shit I will never forget and in the end she said "" listen kiddo, you should try harder, everyones doing they part why don't you work as hard as them?"" 

Oh yes, that funny feeling of sadness and anger. I looked back at her, smiled and said:

""Oh no... Gee you kidding me right? You're fucking kidding with me right that can't be. Is this a joke? Don't you see how hard I work here everyday restless just for a bunch of sick people can just sit scratch their balls and pick their nose? Nah hell no ma'am, I'm leaving. Here, take my credentials and shove it *throws on the balcony open the door and leaves*

Welp, maybe it was a overreaction but man, I felt like I was born again. Like a Fenix rising in the cold skies of a dark and silent night, and yes, it got me fired.

Perspective from a Gen-Z individual,10,rdmne7,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdmne7/perspective_from_a_genz_individual/,9,1639181563,"To preface this, I've posted quite a bit in this sub throwing out the same rhetoric, but I thought I'd make a post going in depth as to how \*I\* feel as someone in the minority age wise in here being 20 years old as of recently.  


With that said, all I feel is doom and gloom. I feel like there is nothing waiting for me in the future. Throughout all my life my school system always pushed out the narrative that I had to go to college or I'd just end up poor. My 2 older brothers and a few other people I know just proved that college didn't help their situation. My two older brothers were underemployed for many years before pivoting to the military and manual labor respectively since there were opportunities to be had there. I also had a co-worker in retail who had a master's degree, and I don't know what she's doing now.  


I personally was about to go to college before covid postponed plans. Honestly, the timing couldn't have been better. I've started becoming more aware about how our society operates and became more educated on various topics. I even developed my own skills which has allowed me to make some money while I'm stuck at home. If I didn't postpone my plans indefinitely I would have went through college with no plan and in a major that statistically holds little to no ROI with the current costs of college. I \*wanted\* to go to learn something, but with how much college costs that isn't just something you could do. I also have no interest in engineering or comp sci or whatever those ""employable"" majors are. Now I see myself in a conundrum.  


College is stupid expensive nowadays, but now more than ever are employers looking for those ""credentials"" just for a chance to get that 15 an hour job with no benefits and no means to be able to pay off debt. Underemployment seems to be one of those things people forget when they throw out all of these statistics about college \*always\* being worth it and it bothers me. Hell, my European friends laugh when they saw some of the job requirements for some of the jobs from here. A bachelor's degree for a damn secretarial job, what is this garbage? 

Here's the thing, I get signalling is a thing but what happens if everyone has a degree? look for higher requirements. It's a bullcrap excuse to just lower the amount of resumes you have to look through. My friends that are currently in college admittedly cheat and/or procrastinate because why not? For some of them, they aren't even the ones paying for college. There are so many people who want to go to college to just learn, and there are so many more who are going just to fuck around, yet it seems the latter will be the ones ending up with better job prospects, or so we think.  


Once again, I do not regret postponing my plans indefinitely. My brothers are kinda just glad I didn't go in general since I won't need to deal with the BS they got. I got noticed by some employers for some skills I developed and showcase, but the issue being they certainly don't pay enough for me to live. I'm fortunate to have parents who care and will allow me to stay with them, but not everyone will have that luxury. Retail pays more than what employers offered me, but the mental stress of retail isn't worth 16 bucks an hour. Then what? It seems like getting a living wage is few and far inbetween nowadays. Whereas my parents immigrated here from the Philippines with no prior higher education and made a life for themselves here. I am appreciative for the life they given me, but I don't want to worry them forever because my life may end up being worse than theirs.  


Just thought I'd ask, what ever happened to training people? What happened to high school being enough to succeed? Why aren't high school standards keeping up with today's job market? I just feel stuck now. Choosing not to go in debt makes me feel like I'm destined for low-paying jobs now. On the other hand, going to college is slowly becoming a gamble and may leave you being worse off than if you didn't go at all.

"New job, boss got laid off this week",11,rdmkoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdmkoa/new_job_boss_got_laid_off_this_week/,3,1639181327,"So I started a new job a month ago or so and found out this week that my boss was being laid off today. 

First off, he's a really good dude who was willing to pick up extra hours for us and was a great advocate for his workers. He would go out of his way to make sure we never had to work more than 5 days in a row or 40 hours a week. He would regularly take extra shifts and was always around to help out. 

Second, our team is already really short staffed. Without revealing too much detail, the company I work at is in a large market and we have to be able to have someone available 19/24 hours of the day. Right now, we're essentially trying to balance that load across 3 people. This is not an easy task when things get fast paced, and without having our boss around to help out, we're kind of fucked some days.

Third, the higher ups keep saying they'll hire another person for our department, but I'm not a dipshit. I looked at the job postings and there's nothing there. They keep saying they'll crosstrain other people to help out, but that isn't fair to them and I don't blame them for not taking extra work for no pay.

Fourth, they didnt even bother to set up a new chain of command. I had my schedule changed today without my knowledge and ended up having to leave the office alone for two hours because nobody told me that a coworker was taking today off, and our calendar wasn't updated.

Fifth, I can't get past the feeling of guilt that I'm his replacement. I hate the idea that they hired me so they could pay me less and chop him. That's fucking bullshit. I have no idea if that's the case, but it really feels like it.

I don't know what the point I'm making is. This sucks and I feel powerless. I've only been here a month, what can I do? And what happens if my coworkers quit? Morale is insanely low right now, so it wouldn't surprise me. 

The worst part is that we're in a right to work state, so it feels like a union is off the table. How are we supposed to be able to take time off? There's nobody to fill the shifts! The worst part is that we're moving to ""unlimited"" PTO next year, so they aren't required to give us dick.",12/11/21 2:08

Most of our dogs are over 50 lbs with about 7-8 being over 75lbs. Wednesday was the first day I could walk without a boot 2 days later she puts me in for a daycare shift. I tell her I can do it if there's two other employees in back qbr I'll probably be on the bench a lot. (I can do cleaning a socializing but couldn't break up another fight or respond to emergency quickly if need be. I come in to one other person, and a three hour period alone with 25 dogs for a 9 hour shift, and booked to clean all of our play park equipment, the other 6 hours I have only one other employee in back with me.
By the end of it I'm bruised, in immense pain and can barely walk again
 I text my manager letting her know what happened and to not book me the next week for daycare. She texts back I have no right to request something like that when we're understaffed and that I'm being passive aggressive.

I don’t know much about working, standards, and conditions besides for what I read here on this sub and a few other sources. 

when I started applying to jobs around me, I realize a lot of businesses were trying to make me spend money so I would be hired by them. 

for example, I went to an interview for a job I didn’t know too much about, but it was the first place to get back to me. without too many questions being asked, they said that I was hired. I still didn’t know the pay, what I was really going to be doing as it wasn’t described well to me, etc.

*I would also like to add that I did ask about how much I would get paid at the end of the interview, after they told me I was hired, and they told me it was unprofessional to ask that in the interview and that we would talk about it at a different time.*

A few days after completing the interview, they said I was going to have to get a few things done in order for me to keep the job. i had to pay for my background check, fingerprinting, and my uniform. reminding you, this is my first job, I had no savings, my parents and I no longer have a relationship so I don’t have parents who can pay for me.. so i got a loan. I figured I’d be working soon, that loan I pull out I could pay off soon enough.

well, after I let them know I paid for all the things they asked, they said I was going to have to go through three months of 3 different trainings,and I would have to pay for one of the trainings. what made it worse, is them mentioning that I would not be getting paid during my times of training, and that it was a minimum wage job. I also was told in the interview that it was a full-time position, but after I paid for all those things, she said their only open position at the moment is part time and so that’s what I would be working as.

I work with a bunch of 40+ year old women who are always angry and nitpick everything. Also rude to customers and lack common sense. I got a write-up for calling off one Saturday. I got accused that I clogged the toilet and was being threatened with a write-up. I use a alternate version of my name since everyone calls me that and I was accused that I use a fake name. 

Today I was 6 mins late since I was working at another job that I got and upon arriving my coworker tells me,
""(My ID name in what I usually don't enjoy being called as vs. my altered name), you are going to get a write up! You need to stop being late. We work 6 hours, we cannot stay longer since this is what the company wants.""

I told her sure, she can shove it where she knows, because I am quitting and I am tired of harassment and being nitpicked when I do everything at this store.

Not totally uncommon in small offices to be closed the day after Thanksgiving and to make it an additional PTO day.
I work for a small proeprty management company in the main office under the brother and sister who inherited it from their parents. 
I was told to not mention that were not going to be in the office on the Friday following Thanksgiving so the employees at the properties we manage didn't  feel bad. This was a red flag among many other things they have done to tenants without their knowledge.  For example, entering their unit and taking photos of their unit interior including boudoir photos of the tenant to show around the office and make fun of them because of their sexual orientation.

My new position there is the manager who loves to talk about how we work to serve the people and how we must work as a team. I already have several new recruits like me who were pulled aside and get reamed about how they were 5, 2, or 1 minute late back from break or more recently 30 seconds late from lunch. I was informed by multiple people that supervisors were talking behind my back and overhearing (most likely speaking loud enough on purpose) about how the day is going well, except for working with me. The supervisors would all look at people with disdain when they get asked questions, as if mentally questioning how such fools were hired in the first place whether or not they're new to the position.

I was pulled aside today and was spoken to in a very passive aggressive manner about how other people have ""voluntarily"" left and asked if I'm really even bothering to try staying here. Others have openly complained about how I ask too many questions and was told to just look at the handbook and stop bothering them. I can see why the local populace have a strong distrust and outright hatred for any company that has anything to do with legal documents. I can see why because despite what they say about ""being a paragon of customer service and always ensuring they understand what they need"" the manager and supervisors sure as hell don't give a damn, not for the people and certainly not for us. I guess you trade health insurance and a $1 raise from retail for your body and soul where in retail it was just my body.

How to Ask for a Raise,4,rdlrvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdlrvr/how_to_ask_for_a_raise/,2,1639179026,"I see this question a lot on here, so I want to offer a summary of a great column on this topic (link to article at bottom).

When you ask for a raise, explain why you’ve earned it. Be prepared to explain what impact you’ve made. What have you received especially positive feedback about? What results are you most proud of? Where have you made the biggest impact? Explain it to the manager as if they don't already know. Use data and numbers whenever possible.

Most of the time it can be pretty quick and to-the-point, like these examples:

* “I’m really appreciative of the opportunities the company has given me for greater responsibilities and more challenging work. I’ve been excelling at these new responsibilities for 14 months now, have consistently exceeded my goals, and have brought in new business as well. I’d like to talk about adjusting my salary to reflect this higher level of contribution.”
* “I was hoping that we could talk about my salary. It’s been a year since my last raise, and in that time, I’ve taken on quite a few new responsibilities. I’m now overseeing our admin staff and, as you mentioned last week, our results in that area have shot way up. I’ve also been been able to resolve the concerns we’d had about Jane’s relations with vendors; that area has been going really smoothly since I began working with her. In addition, I know you’re happy with the changes that I’ve made to accounts receivable, and late payments are down by 80%. Now that I’ve been doing these things for a while, I’m hoping we can increase my salary to a level that reflects this new work.

Reference work you’ve already done. Unless you are negotiating a raise for a position with more responsibility, don't make it about what you might do in the future.

Make a case based on your value to your employer. It’s all about why your value to your employer has increased.

"Hired and fired and fired within a week, HR lied for no reason, job opening still up if you want it.",2,rdlq4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdlq4d/hired_and_fired_and_fired_within_a_week_hr_lied/,6,1639178885,"If this sounds weird to you it's because it is.

I'm new to this subreddit but my friend told me to post my most recent ""job experience"" here so here goes:

I interviewed November 29th, 2021, literally last week. Both interviewers were definitely interested in me and I received the job offer December 1st, 2021, within the same week. I verbally accepted December 2nd, 2021.

The interview was with an insurance company not sure if it matters.

I found out about the job through my aunt who's friend's husband (we'll call him Greg) who used to work there. Keep in mind he was there for 14 years.  I applied because he said there was an opening. It should also be mentioned that I am the sole caretaker of my mother, grandmother, and grandfather and have been since May 2020. So essentially this would have been my first career job since graduating from college in 2020. Also at this time, my grandmother was leaving the hospital and my grandfather caught a random ass stomach bug which lead to some nasty and *uncontrollable* number 2s at 4am for multiple days.

I had not yet signed my offer letter  because I knew I had the job and was was dealing with aforementioned shitty situation. The man who interviewed me (who we shall call Kyle) emailed me asking if I was still interested on December 6th. I responded ""Yes"" the same day and also mentioned that I was in the middle of family emergencies but I was completing the paper work as we speak.

December 8th, my offer was rescinded without explanation.

I reached out to the woman who works in ""talent acquisition"" (who we shall call Karen) who sent me that email and basically asked wtf. the respectfully. She called back the next day and said because I ""had not been responsive"" and ""failed to complete the paperwork within 48 hours"" my offer was rescinded. I did not even know that was a policy. She said I needed to do a drug screening within that 48 hours which seemed absurd because the turn around for a drug screening is 1-5 business days. I told her everything I told Ken and she said ""Well I take care of family too and we all go through things but you can't just be unresponsive. You still should've reached out."" I told her that she was being completely illogical because I DID reach out, just not to her and I thought it would suffice. She just just kept repeating over and over again that I was uncommunicative and that it was out of her control because ""I didn't act like I wanted the job."" Girl what?

At this point I'm literally about to cry because I obviously applied because I need money and this woman's complete lack of empathy from this ""client centered company"" was sending me. I guess it's f\*ck the workers then.

So much about this situation seemed to contradict itself. The first problem is, Ken emailed me after this 48 hour period so if that was the case, why didn't he just tell me I was too late? I would've been totally fine with that. Second, I literally signed my offer letter and got the ""congratulations welcome to the team!"" screen. Third, when on the phone with Karen she said there's other positions on the site and the same position still needs to be filled so I should consider reapplying...?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I literally re-applied the same day I was told my termination was finalized. Then at about 4pm something that day, she told me they had moved on with other candidates and I should seek other employment and to ""Have a great day!"" K.

I told my aunt and she was confused as well. She reached out to Greg and he reached out to his old boss to just ask what happened My aunt reported back:

*""Greg called HR. They told him the matter was confidential and they will not speak with him about it. They asked how he knew about the situation and Kyle told him how it came about that he learned from your niece. Greg even tried asking generically whether your niece needed to reapply for the job or just reapply for the drug screen and the HR rep abruptly cut him off and said they could not continue the conversation.""*

This seems shady with red flags all around. Am I wrong?

Wtf.

&#x200B;

TL;DR

I applied to a place. Got the job. Was terminated basically within a week for illogical reasons.

I have a BS in chemistry that cost me $80k in student loans and has gotten me exactly zero jobs. (No one wants to hire *just* a chemistry undergrad, and I couldn't afford grad school even if my grades qualified me, which they didn't.) Graduated in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. I flitted from job to job while battling crippling depression because I thought it was my fault that I could never land my dream job, or even a job in my field, due to my lack of experience and my mediocre academics. So I finally got some help from my parents to pursue another career in veterinary medicine. Again my grades prevented me from applying to vet school, but I completed a 2-year associate's degree and obtained my license as a veterinary technician. Nevermind the fact that it took me 5 years to do because I was working full-time as a vet assistant for $10/hr while I was in school, which was actually a *requirement* to remain enrolled in the distance learning program. Now 5 years later, 2 years as a specialized surgery technician doing the work of a nurse anesthetist, a nurse practitioner, a critical care nurse, a radiology tech, a physical therapist, and a family liaison - on multiple species - and the overtime and the on-call hours finally burned me out. I work at a ""regular"" vet now, and in the last 6 months I've increased their revenue by 60% while massively overhauling their entire work flow and cleaning/maintenance structure so that it actually meets some semblance of a standard of care established within the last 30 years.

I make $21.5k a year. I work for a corporation that caps raises at 4% per year. Yeah, I get to work with animals and do something I'm passionate about. But the skill set I have is easily on par (in terms of breadth of knowledge, not necessarily in terms of the research and technology, which is nowhere close) with human nurses that make $110k+. I'm not arguing that I should make that much - the education and experience and the stakes involved for human nurses are on another level. But the fact that I have ""LVT"" after my name raised my wages by $2 or $3 an hour. I'm a single woman with no children and I can barely keep up with monthly bills, much less save for retirement. I finally qualified for my company's 401(k) plan last month. Do you know what they offer? A whopping 25% matching, up to 4%... Like, for real!? I'm 36, I can't afford to live paycheck to paycheck anymore. My job is physically demanding and I'm already battling chronic injuries from bending and lifting huge dogs every day. How am I supposed to retire like this? What about when I can no longer physically keep up with the demands of my job?

Sorry for the rant. I know other professions have it worse. But don't know anyone in the veterinary field who has this shit figured out. I know I can't be alone. But for some reason we're just expected to suffer because we love animals and we chose this field, knowing that it was ""hard"" and ""thankless?"" It's fucking bullshit. If we complain or demand better compensation, we're reminded that there are at least 5 naive teenagers eager to replace us. If we aren't willing to stay late to pick up slack or make up for our doctors' absent-mindedness or straight up incompetence, we're reminded that we're just technicians, so we should keep our opinions to ourselves.

I'm so tired. I feel betrayed by the boomer generation that keeps repeating the same old shit. ""Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life."" ""Just apply yourself in school and you'll end up in your dream job, with a house and a family and everything you ever wanted."" This is not the American dream. Burn it all down.",12/11/21 1:23

No wonder Rockefellar funded education and had vested interest in it. The education system comes from the Prussian model. 

Therefore, preventing the indoctrination from infiltrating to the next generation is a must in order to truly tackle the corporate agenda. 

Here is an excerpt from an article:

“The system of education that we use in the United States (and many other nations) is called the Prussian Model. Born of Prussia’s military failings in the Napoleonic Wars, the German kingdom developed an “education” system designed to indoctrinate children, year-by-year, from age 6 to 16, into full compliance with the state and its military leaders. The point was, bluntly, to ensure that “no German soldier would ever disobey an order again.”
The system worked. To the world’s horror, German soldiers and citizens — despite growing up in what seemed like a liberal democracy — a socialist liberal democracy at that — committed any atrocity asked of them during World War II.
The Prussian Model largely explains why American and British schools are so often staffed by compliant rule followers and petty tyrants.”",12/11/21 1:08

But what you probably didn't know was that a 30 hour workweek was proposed over ***89 years ago!*** (a brief overview: [https://www.encyclopedia.com/economics/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/black-thirty-hour-bill](https://www.encyclopedia.com/economics/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/black-thirty-hour-bill))

If a 30 hour workweek was available to us 89 years ago, but a 32 hour is only available to us now, you'd have to believe that all the advancement in technology/automation, productivity, and science has amounted to nothing.  You'd have to believe that ALL the labor being performed since has been necessary. 

We all know why the workweek can't be reduced: the basis of profit is surplus (now superfluous) labor-time.  Unpaid labor-time \*is\* surplus-value.   So just imagine how much of this exists since 1932 (and I'm not speaking about 'wage theft' or garnishing paychecks or fees.  I'm speaking directly to the wages paid to labor-power having grown entirely opposite the value produced by it).   

What the authors of this bill are admitting, much like those that defeated the 1932 Black Bill, is that there is a hours of labor threshold which cannot be crossed, lest the mode of production collapse into the abyss.  Lest prices and profits sink along with capital values.  

It is not up to the state to determine what the length of the workweek is.  They will sell you short every time.  We can go lower, much much lower!",12/11/21 0:52

A woman in [Thailand](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/thailand) allegedly blew up the oil warehouse where she worked because she was angry with her [boss](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/boss).

The worker, named as 38-year-old Ms Sirisini or Ann Sriya by [police](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/police), has been accused of using a lighter to set [fire](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/fire) to a piece of paper before throwing it on to a fuel container at the Prapakorn Oil warehouse in Thailand.

The fire, which caused more than 40 million Thai baht (about £900,000) worth of [damage](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/damage), quickly spread through the building, used to store thousands of litres of oil tanks.

Images  shared on social media showed a fireball and thick black smoke  billowing into the air above the single-storey warehouse in Nakhon  Pathom province.

CCTV footage, allegedly of Ms Sriya, shows a  person walking into a warehouse with a piece of paper in their hand  before disappearing behind a row of containers on a shelving unit.

 Flames can then be seen coming from a two locations behind the containers before the person reappears, still carrying the paper.

Punished by Rewards,10,rdkrhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdkrhg/punished_by_rewards/,5,1639176111,"There's a book called ""Punished by Rewards"" by a guy named Alfie Kohn. The book is about raising and educating children, but I think much of it is largely applicable to work and life in general.

To summarize the jist of it, which you probably pick up on by the title, is that rewards and punishments aren't significantly different—they're two sides of the same coin: means to control.

Most of the so-called benefits work gives us are merely means of controlling us. The most obvious and egregious example of this is insurance: the employer provides health insurance to the employee, and the employee is beholden to their work for fear of becoming indebted after some awful accident or stroke of misfortune. Thus, this perceived benefit or 'perk' is little more than a way of tying people to their bullshit, time-and-soul-sucking, monotonous, fattening jobs.

Anyway, I don't want to go off on too much of a rant, but I highly suggest any of you read Kohn's writing through the lens of work. Or just in general. If you're a parent or not (I'm not). It provides an incredible way to think about your own experiences that can be enlightening.

I see hopeless sentiments being spread so frequently amongst this community and it isn't going to do any good for any of us if we allow hopelessness to consume us and our emotions. Acknowledging the adversities that we all face is great and creates an awareness and conversation around the subject, but we must face it head on by resisting in any way we are able to. Even if that means just discussing our ideas with those who don't understand them. Plant the seed in their minds! 

I've seen ex rightwingers come here to join us in this movement. People of our kind calling me out years ago is what made me question being a libertarian conspiracy theorist and turned me into a leftist who stands with and for the people! Civilized discussion made me reconsider my worldview and flip it from being for the rich to make as much as they want and to destroy everything, to wanting to hold them accountable for their crimes against all life. I see and believe in the power and value of the working class and the influence it has.

It seems some people commenting and posting in r/lostgeneration, r/latestagecapitalism, and here in r/antiwork would rather have a collapse and just give up on everything just like that. Funny enough, even r/politics is starting to spread these hopeless, dystopian sentiments too. ""The authoritarians have won! Democracy is dead or never existed in the first place"", they all say. If we say we've lost so quickly, then we surely will. Did minority groups give up on civil rights? No. They keep trying and we've made much progress, regardless of the fact they are still fighting these issues today. Did the Union workers at Kellogg's settle and give in? No! We are still showing support! What about Jon Deere? They had a victory because they continued to try, regardless of having ""replacements"" sent in.

This subreddit's subscriber numbers shot up in such a short period of time from when I first joined. It was in the low hundreds of thousands when I joined and now it's over 1 million. Antiwork sentiments have become far more discussed all around me. Even my workplace is seeing the effects of this resistance and ""working shortage"" too! Franchise places are falling apart around me. Businesses are struggling to find workers because they can't treat their workers right. I see places closing! This is the effect of our resistance. It isn't an instantaneous thing! This is a linear progression we must continue on if we wish to see a better world.

Millennials and Gen Z'ers are backing up those that got fired by Kellogg's by spamming their application systems and disrupting them with a program somebody made as a tool to help us resist. We're actively promoting a boycott on them. People are actively quitting their shitty jobs in record numbers with no sign of it stopping still. People are sabotaging work places. I saw Antiwork at around 1.2 million subscribers last week. Look! It's at 1.3 now! Still climbing!!! So why not keep on pushing?!?!

Change starts at the roots of our lives (as cheesy as that sounds lol) Talk to your families, friends, and coworkers about this constantly, even if it doesn't stick with them. I discussed pay with my work crew that I supervise this week. We all had a great talk and it united us even further rather than pit us against one another. We are in agreement that when one leaves, we all do. Tell them this benefits EVERYBODY, even if they resist your points at first. Show nothing but stoicism in your discussions and don't get emotional or use slander against them. Show them how this helps THEM. Show them through taking action to uphold your beliefs. Show them you mean well for everybody.

My dad was suuuuper pro work before and would always blame myself and working class people with sentiments like ""not trying hard enough"", ""just getting a better job"", ""not investing enough"", or ""Service jobs are for teenagers and college students"". Now that I've had discussion after discussion with him, he's starting to steadily fall into understanding these issues through me continually expressing the adversities my girlfriend and I face over and over, while telling him that we're still thriving regardless of these adversities. He responded very negatively at first, but later on, I found out that he couldn't believe the reality we face and has no clue how to help people like you and I, so he used to respond with shutting me down, being angry, and using condescension to beat me down. He is easing in and his cruel sentiments are nearly dead after continued effort. AND THIS MAN IS A PRIVELEDGED NARCISSIST!!! I've even got him to make fun of how much material shit he has and is reconsidering so much of it and he feels odd about it all now. He's thinking outside of his castle now! My mom is antiwork now too even though she has a well paying job too. All because I had some difficult talks with her about it all too (although she wasn't as difficult as my dad).

I show them how work has taken time away from family and that we've missed out on so much time together. I show them what brings meaning to my life. I show them the pursuits I have and why. I show them that I wish to bring something meaningful to our lives rather than work for a rich guy to enjoy themselves. I show them that I am not lazy like my dad claims. I am driven. I am just driven differently than what society and others expect of me.

Make them see the human that you, they, and I all are. This will lead to solidarity of the people to unite against evil and fascism. These evil fascists who are trying to rule things with an iron fist are in the minority and even moreso as time goes on.

The authoritarians and their supporters are becoming the minority, so they are becoming louder and angrier because they fear our resistance! We are interconnected now more than ever. These are the beginning stages of their way ending and they will have no choice but to eventually give into being humane. The authoritarians are afraid of this resistance and of finally being held accountable, so they will do anything to shut us down and put doubt into our minds. DO NOT LET THEM BREAK YOUR WILL!!!

"Fired for ""not having initiative""",1,rdkhh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdkhh0/fired_for_not_having_initiative/,3,1639175355,"This happened years ago. I had been hired as a marketing temp for a medium-sized company and started off pretty well - within the first month I had already developed new templates and improved many of the department processes we used. The VP even called me into his office to tell me how much he liked my work.

Our team consisted of 3 people - the marketing manager (""John""), a marketing assistant (""Cameron""), and me. John was a great manager but he traveled a lot, which means that I spent most of the time working next to Cameron, who was around my age (early 20s).

Cameron had a generic business associate's degree and I had just finished my bachelor's in marketing with 3 years of full-time internships in the area. He didn't even know how to use PowerPoint, so he wasn't too happy to see that I had more experience than him and that I was making a difference and impressing the higher-ups.

I had been there for around 3 months when we got assigned to work at the grand opening of one of our branches, about 2 hours away, and Cameron was supposed to drive us there. That day we went to lunch with the sales team and I noticed that he didn't seem too worried about the time; in fact, he took his sweet time making jokes and even ordered dessert.

As a result, we arrived 10 minutes before the event started. Cameron blamed it on traffic but the bosses weren't too annoyed as we got right down to work and everything went smoothly.

A few days later, when John was out of town, Cameron called me into a conference room and told me I was being let go. The reason, according to him, was that I was supposed to show initiative by telling him during that lunch that we needed to go, and that because of *me* we had arrived late at the event.

Unfortunately, I was too young and naïve to say anything. Not that I cared about continuing to work next to a jealous, spiteful SOB because he would have found other ways to set me up. So yeah, sometimes it's better to just keep a low profile, do what you're told, and not go above and beyond because even if the customers and VPs appreciate you, there's always going to be someone who's just one level ahead ready to throw you under the bus when their incompetence shows and they feel threatened by you.",12/11/21 0:29

They take as much shit than everyone. They will have to push stupid policies to others and do everything they can to grind the ladder, because it sucks to be in the middle:

- They are despised by most people they manage
- They are not respected, listened by the upper management
- They have a very similar pay to the ones they are managing

Why managers are on this sub?
- Because they are employees too
- They want to make a positive change too

Are all country clubs this bad?,4,rdk9ne,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdk9ne/are_all_country_clubs_this_bad/,8,1639174759,"A country club I worked for was straight up using the servers tips to pay the management ""bonuses"". I talked to a server who was promoted to a management position and was told shortly afterwards that due to economic reasons they were going to reduce his salary. They told him they would give him the majority of the servers tip share to compensate him. He quit because he he wasn't a POS. 

I worked back of house and know that they always did this. I was in charge of the banquets and knew from the chef how much they were charging per head. 

On most Fridays and Saturdays we would do 3 or 4 parties of 50-200 each. They were at least $30 a head so a party of 100 is $3000. They automatically charge a 20% gratuity for everything, so $600 a party in tips. A party of 100 usually had about 5 servers and a couple busboys. So a server should be getting at least $100 per party and would usually work at least two of these a weekend plus whatever tables they worked during the week. So they should easily be pulling $200 a week just from banquets, but I know they usually got less than $300 for a full weeks work.

I understand that they aren't necessarily having to serve food during the banquets, but they are setting everything up, getting drinks, clearing tables, and cleaning everything up afterwards.

I asked a few of them why they didn't make a fuss over it and usually it was because they were afraid of getting fired or they figured they couldn't do better anywhere else. They were also told that any cash tips were to be given to their manager.

I thought about using ""cuntry"" in place of ""country"", but wasn't sure if it was too offensive. 😆",12/11/21 0:19

"I was replaced with the training system I created, demoted, offered less pay, and they had the audacity to be shocked when I quit after being bullied over the scheduling for two months.",24,rdk48j,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdk48j/i_was_replaced_with_the_training_system_i_created/,7,1639174347,"I've been considering sharing this story for a while now. It's not something I got to discuss much after it happened, but I think this community will appreciate it.

I worked for Chick-fil-A for about five years. It's been a hot minute, so I don't feel bad name dropping them here. I wasn't especially religious, but they were willing to hire me when I was freshly moved into the state, and they offered good pay. And I was ambitious at the time. I moved up quickly in the first couple of years, and eventually became the Training Director. That meant that I knew how to do every position in the store (front of house AND back of house), as well as how to effectively train for every position. I was in charge of on-boarding the new hires, setting up their training schedules, and making sure they were ready to be scheduled in position after two weeks. And I'll go ahead and toot my own horn - I was damn good at what I did. A few months after the promotion, our retention rate leapt, as did our sales, drive thru numbers, and ratings online. I won't attribute all of it to my training; we hired on some fantastic people in that time. But I will say that my training team helped those people learn quickly and feel confident in what they were doing.

After being in the position for a while, I developed a new training system to help my team and the shift leads train more effectively. We had training iPads, and I used an app to develop a system that allowed for more streamlined tracking of each new hire's training, online and in person. My team picked it up pretty quickly, and our numbers continued to rise. More team members were asking to become trainers and work under me, and the turnover was the best it had been since I'd started working there.

About a year into having this position, there was a small retreat for all the directors. On this retreat, our store operator announced that the director positions were going to be salaried, as well as receive some fantastic benefits. I was ECSTATIC. As a college student, this was huge. My pay would effectively jump by about $10hr. I'd be able to replace my crappy car finally. I could pay for school out of pocket instead of loans. Everything was going to get so much easier. Plus - no more overtime in order to make ends meet! I could focus on school more.

A week after the retreat, my direct boss (one position below our operator) pulled me aside. In a very short, blunt conversation, she informed me that to cut costs for the store, she was dissolving the position of Training Director and placing the area directors in the store in charge of their own training. She said thanks to the system I'd created, they could handle it on their own without my having to oversee everything. I would instead be basically a shift lead again, but she wanted me to do the store scheduling too, so that I could still receive a raise (about $4hr I think it was). I was devastated. At the time I was very dedicated to my job, and very proud of how good I was at it. But I swallowed my pride and accepted the demotion. I needed the good pay. I did warn her that I thought it was a terrible idea - removing my position would make the other directors' jobs harder, and training and turnover would suffer because of it. She said it would be fine.

Big surprise, I was right. The other directors didn't have the time or know-how to really focus on training for new hires. Our turnover started to skyrocket again. Numbers dropped. People started to get really unhappy with how bad the new hires coming in seemed to be. It was miserable. And since I was doing the scheduling for the store, it started to affect me too - I had no one to schedule for certain positions on certain shifts. And my boss's response whenever I brought that to her attention was ""just make it happen.""

The final straw for me was when I was struggling with the schedule for a Saturday. Saturdays were always the busiest days for us, naturally. So it was expected that someone be scheduled for EVERY position during our peak hours. As I was making the schedule I got to the point where there were about five or six empty positions for the lunch rush. We could've operated without them, easily; they were positions meant to just help some with speed in the drive thru and kitchen. But my boss saw them as necessary. She told me to call around, ask people to work outside of their availability, and just make it happen. So I printed a list of every person currently working for the store. I crossed out everyone I'd already scheduled. I contacted everyone who wasn't available and asked them to work (they all said no, of course). I circled all those names and made notes. I brought the list to my boss and said, ""I can't fill those positions. Here's a list of everyone in the store. Everyone who can be scheduled is scheduled."" She glanced over the list, shrugged, and said, ""Make it happen. Those positions need to be filled.""

I was LIVID. I was stressed beyond belief, exams were coming up and I was clocking in off the property to work on the damn schedule instead of studying. I was over it. Did she expect me to just shit people out who could work that day? I'd brought her PROOF it was literally impossible. I turned in my two weeks that day. The next morning I had an email from my boss thanking me for my notice and informing me that they ""would no longer be needing my services."" Honestly, good riddance. The place is a cult and was so toxic and bad for my mental health. I should've quit sooner.

I checked in on them a while after I left, through some friends who were still working there. Turns out, my quitting caused a bit of an exodus. Three shift leads quit after me, along with a handful of team members. They dropped from a 4.8 on Google and Yelp to a 3.2. Drive thru times were horrible and the schedule was an absolute mess, with some mornings having only two people in the kitchen and one up front. I took a kind of smug pride in the fact that they tanked for a while without me.

Just goes to show, one bad manager can really tank an entire workplace. Also, know your worth. I wish I hadn't just rolled over and accepted the demotion, I should've fought for it. But honestly, it's probably best it worked out the way it did.",12/11/21 0:12

Ultimately, I want to be prepared to interview them in the same way they're interviewing me, but don't really know where to begin. Are there any current job seekers who have some sage wisdom they can impart?",12/11/21 0:09

Sometimes I feel like people don't know the half of it. I'm under qualified for anything that pays decent wages because I wasn't shown how to do this ""life"" thing. What really sucks is I scored a job that payed 13usd/hr. Unfortunately the place literally lied to me about what I would be doing and imposed a higher work load due to being understaffed. I was supposed to be a delivery driver, not a shit stained couch cleaner. Not to mention the soulless management team who ""do the best to help out our customers"" yet I literally heard them calling the customers broke ass bitches, druggies, etc..

Inflation calculations are calculated by the party opposing the president. Including reviewing the inflation for the last 50 years since the implementation of planned obsolescence, which adds features to the ""basket of goods"" (BoG) increasing the value of the BoG but hasn't accounted for obsolescence and accordingly decreased the value of the BoG.

I told my boss two days ago I was getting the first shot of the vaccine and I'll likely be out sick the next two days. Two days go by, I tell him I still feel gnarly and I won't be in for my shift. This is 7 hours before my shift, not including the warning days ago.

I'm told I need a doctor's note. I said I'm not getting out of bed. He says I won't be able to return to work without one. I say then I won't be able to return to work. 

A couple minutes pass and he says ""well just be there tomorrow"".

It might seem insignificant but I'm young and have only just recently became aware of the abuse and exploitation so many businesses use, I've learned a lot here. This small action felt very liberating for me.

Working 12 hour shifts with NO WATER and minimal breaks,12,rdjb4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdjb4r/working_12_hour_shifts_with_no_water_and_minimal/,2,1639172159,"I work at a COVID Testing Site, the pay is decent. Okay fair enough. Our shift pattern is 4 days on and 4 days off, with overtime always available. 

We work in outdoor conditions, currently as it's winter so it's a lot colder then usual. Down where I work we have a ""green zone"" and a ""red zone"". The ""red zone"" is where the 'customers' will come into the test site, we don't usually get many 'customers' coming into the test site so we spend all day just standing around waiting for people to enter the text site, as crazy as it sounds it is extremely exhausting for the mental health. 

Down the ""red zone"", we are not allowed usage of our mobile phones, regardless of the situation, even if you had an emergency phone call coming in, you cannot use your mobile phone or you will be potentially fired. Another thing, you are not allowed ANY food or water down this area. Not even a bottle of water. 

The ""green zone"" is pretty much the exact opposite, you can go on your phone, drink water/eat food but you are not allowed up there unless you are on break or using the bathroom. The ""green zone"" has a filthy cafeteria with extremely basic things for us staff to use, such as a broken toaster, and a dirty microwave that is probably older than myself. You will find the 'supervisors' and management up this side of the test site because they can do whatever they like with no consequences, such as take as many breaks as they like, drink as much water as they like or even play around on their mobile phones ALL day long. 

So, there's a catch. Us staff members who work in the ""red zone"" are only allowed two 30 minute breaks a day. We work for 12 hours and we are NOT allowed any more than two 30 minute breaks. This means we are not allowed any food or water and we are expected to work for 11 hours straight without any chance of refreshments or you will potentially be fired. We do nothing but stand around waiting for ""customers"" whom hardly come in, we cannot have any minor pleasures such as a novel, crossword or any electronics it is a ""cross contamination"" risk.  (Take in mind we have zero contact with 'customers' everything is done through a screen)

These rules were made by a group of fat greedy corporate bastards who sit around in a warm cozy office all day long, eating snacks all day with a lovely water facility on demand.

**All of these should be added as amendments to the Constitution that way they can’t easily be overturned or changed.**
 

**Universal healthcare** that everyone pays into and everyone gets no exceptions.


**More rights and protections for the worker** and an increase to the minimum wage set on a scale to increase with GDP, inflation, and cost of living in the area. 


**No more lobbying in the Government**. It is illegal for a singular politician to accept money from an individual or private business. Any monetary donation is put into a city, state, or federal trust. 


**Abolish gerrymandering** and establish a bipartisan organization to realign districts when necessary.


**Get rid of any and all loopholes for tax evasion**. If new loopholes are discovered they’re to be closed immediately. 


**Increase the budget of the IRS** to have the resources to investigate anyone expected to cheat on their taxes. Also,  with the budget increase, Americans will no longer have to fill out forms; it will be all calculated by the IRS. If an individual does not agree with the calculated amount given by the IRS they can dispute by sending in paperwork for it to be adjusted.


**The subject matter of a bill** is not articulated in the title and has context to the main subject. It cannot go through the process of becoming law. (This is to stop politicians from sneaking in the nonsense that doesn't have anything to do with what's trying to be passed. For example a bill about Healthcare with a subset talking about drilling in Alaska.)


**A reinvestment into education**. Both Pre-k to 12 and college. No more private schools for the privileged. All kids will go through public school. (This is to make sure that the family you're born into doesn't decide the fate of your education it's all the same for everyone which should, in turn, make every family care about the education their child is receiving) 



**Police reform** -  There should be federal guidelines to establish how police officers should act in any given situation.  All officers should be trained based on said guidelines regardless of rank. If an officer doesn’t accept the training they are to be laid off. If an officer has been proven to have broken the guidelines they should be subject to the harshest of legal punishment.

**Introduce a nationwide Government-owned ISP**.  Americans for too long have been paying outrageous prices for access to the internet. 


**Make the voting day** a national holiday that everyone gets off with few exceptions.


**Every human being has full body autonomy**. No government local state or federal has the right to enact any laws forcing any kind of control over what people do with their bodies.


**All drugs are decriminalized**. Marijuana is legalized on a federal level. Reinvestment into rehabilitation centers instead of sending people to jail for drug use


**We should amend the Second Amendment**. The amendment states, “This amendment protects the rights of citizens to ""bear arms"" or own weapons such as guns.”


**The new Amendment goes as follows**, “This amendment protects the right of citizens to “bear arms” or own weapons such as guns …  As long as said individual provides proof by obtaining a license for each class of weaponry.”


**How do Obtain a license?**

* You need to be 18 years or older. You may participate in the privilege of handling a firearm if you are the child of someone who has a license and if they are with you during said activity.

* There should be standardized tests for each category of weapon. For example pistols, shotguns, rifles, assault rifles, semi-auto, etc, etc. that you need to pass.

* You need to be able to dismantle, clean your weapon properly, and rebuild it completely.

* You must have “x” number of hours on a shooting range with a Certified instructor showing that you know how to handle your weapon with care and responsibility.
 
* If your weapon is used by someone without a license you will be held accountable to the full extent of the law.


**This is not to hurt gun owners.** This is to stop people from dying from gun violence. If you are going to say, “criminals are going to get guns regardless” I understand that. I think these measures could definitely cut down on the possibility of both criminals and the uneducated from easily getting their hands on a firearm.


If you have suggestions about my 2nd Amendment rework please feel free to let me know. Something constructive not you being mean.

u/bk15dcx - ""**Tax the church**"" - I agree 100% and should be taxed based on income/cos of living in the area. Something to this regard so we don't put them out of business. 


[Link to the google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rNg_0bEUhrZKJW_Bk3-ExwoMcE-tsAP0FXKCK6k2rEU/edit?usp=sharing)

Throughout those 8 years, I sacrificed a LOT, I spent time away from my children to work, I spent hours preparing material. To be fair, while I was there, they did help me out (when it benefited them too, but either way). In the end, in spite of all that  I had to leave. Their hours clashed with the times I had to pick up my kids from school, and I just couldn't do it anymore. There were other problems, like them messing up our taxes, them essentially cheating me out of my teaching materials in order to give them to someone I would've otherwise refused to give them to, etc. I decided not to burn any bridges, told them I had to quit because of the times, and left on good terms. I didn't tell them I had found a new place, because I didn't think that was any of their business. 

Since then, I found a job at another school (which we shall call School X) which suited me perfectly. We finish at 12.30, which means I can comfortably collect my children from school and spend time with them. Today, my new boss sent me an urgent text saying my old school hadn't notified authorities that I had quit, so i won't be able to get paid this month (laws where I live are weird- non US). So I texted my old boss, telling her that school X needs her to cancel my contract ASAP so I can get paid. She then whatsapped me, saying ""School X? Really? I am so disappointed, you could've just been honest. We jumped loopholes for you. Anyway, I'll terminate your contract when I get to school next week. Good luck or whatever"". At that point I was shaking and crying. My new director said he would take it up with the authorities if needs be. Because this bitch won't get off her ass and contact the jobs place, I won't get paid this month, and Christmas will be a very dry affair. I submitted my letter of resignation over a month ago, and she hasn't done it yet.

I've held a sign in a home Depot parking lot in n -30c weather. Now I make 100k a year. I've done technical support for HP, worked on a pig farm, many kitchens and fastfood restaurants. I was always looking for better pay, more money, more freedom. I don't see that value here as much as I think I should. Who would work for Kellogs for 20$ an hour for the rest of their life? It seems absolutely ridiculous. I've moved and left friends and family for job prospects on the other side of the country. Maybe the drive to succeed in life isn't as alive in the newer generations? (I'm 40 now). I really don't want to believe younger people are lazy or weak, although I see my 18 yo son looking for jobs. He'll get hired and work a couple shifts and quit saying ""this isn't what I'm looking for , or ""I'm not interested in it"".my first job was shoveling and pressure washing pig shit for 8 hrs a day. It definitely wasn't what I was looking for or interested in lol, but it payed my car insurance, just barely at $5.65/hr (student wage)/aka no one else will hire you wage.  So my question is why if your job and employer is shit do you stay? Why not try a trade? Or move to somewhere the pay or job availability is better? There are so many people today and the good jobs working for other people are thinner and less profitable than they were 20 years ago I would say simply because of competition. Why don't highschools teach kids how to start their own business? It's super easy. There's a conspiracy theory there somewhere. The powers that be want the general public to remain kids well into adult life to profit off them. It's pretty apperent in today's music and movies. Anyways there's my rant.

Had to get a lawyer to stop the harassment,59,rdifwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdifwt/had_to_get_a_lawyer_to_stop_the_harassment/,9,1639169853,"I worked for a company for a number of years. Traveling weekly, long hours, busting my ass. Everyone knew the owners were scumbags but the money was alright. Not good, but with the OT I made a decent living.

My manager was a great guy. Constantly tried to get me promotions and raises because I was doing way more work than my position entailed. Well, the owners (two brothers) said hell no, we need him at this position and aren't going to pay more. I got a 8 cent raise that year.

So I looked elsewhere. A competitor offered me a job with a 20% raise, more time off, and more potential for growth. I accepted, told my employer, and then all hell broke loose.

HR, my manager, the owners called me into their office and started threatening me. Saying I wasn't allowed to leave because I signed a non compete (spoiler alert: I never did). I laughed and said please show me. 

They pulled out my offer and there was a letter with different colored paper stapled to it saying blah blah can't work for a competitor. No signature, clearly not me.

So I laughed again, said good try I'm still gonna leave can't we just leave on good terms? Nope. They started threatening to sue me, they were gonna sue the company hiring me for 100k because of the training they provided me (in an attempt to scare them off I'm sure).

It freaked me out but I called their bluff, went and started my new job. Then the phone calls from lawyers started coming and letters in the mail. These dickheads we're really trying to press me.

So I did my research and contacted their lawyer. I told them I was going to be suing them for harassment. Never heard a thing from them or that company again.

The Great Resignation has shown us that losing workers hurts these companies just as much - if not more - than losing sales, and that's definitely something we can take advantage of to give weight to our demands for better pay and better working conditions. Thinking about busting unions, engaging in wage theft, or taking away our benefits? Fuck you. Have fun trying to sift through millions of fake applications from across the entire internet during a labor shortage.

These days it often feels like it's impossible for any single one of us to make any real change in the world. Boycotts are only effective if everybody does it, the planet can only be saved if everybody works together, etc. But by conducting asymmetric warfare using application spamming, the power to make social change is back in our individual hands. If we can expand on the software written in the last few days for generating fake resumes and submitting fake applications online, any lone actor can effectively DDoS any company's recruiting efforts and cripple their workforce. While this will likely create an arms race between our application spamming efforts and the HR recruiting departments of every company, I welcome it as it will force every company to either start listening to an entire generation of disenfranchised workers or waste tons of resources fighting a losing battle against us peasants.

In the meantime, we don't even need to wait for the nerds on GitHub to give us these tools for enacting this plan. All it takes is for everybody reading to waste a few minutes a day manually submitting applications and accepting interviews for jobs they have no intention of actually taking. Anybody who's been on the other side of the hiring process can tell you how much time is spent interviewing dozens of candidates just to fill one role, even *with* automated application screening. There is definitely an upper limit to the number of applicants a company is able to process in a given time span. Just imagine the damage we could do by flooding them with fake applications and even accepting interviews to string them along. Hell, if you're really bored you could even start accepting awful jobs and just be really incompetent at it to slow down their operations while making them pay you until they're forced to fire you. We really have nothing to lose, especially because they've already taken everything from us!

Finally, I just wanted to mention that we can't just be targeting companies like this directly. A lot of these abusive jobs at larger companies are sourced through temp agencies, so spam them with applications too! No companies are safe, no matter how big or small. We're coming for you.",12/10/21 22:55

Sent this to everyone in my former company who’s phone number i had last Friday,10,rdicu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdicu9/sent_this_to_everyone_in_my_former_company_whos/,10,1639169619,"*** i sent this to all my coworkers, my boss and his boss ***

Why I'm quitting effective immediately: By Name Redacted for privacy

1) upper management kept literally(not figuratively but literally) daring me to find a better job... probably shouldn't make that dare in the best Jobs market in the history of our country.

2) if this was a publicly traded company i would have to report it to the FTC for trying to short its stock by driving down profits intentionally.

3) many consumers work until 5pm still, maybe in markets that huge numbers of people started working from home ending routes earlier makes sense but not in other places. Yet the company keeps pushing time windows further back.

4) we are essentially mobile grocery stores, yet we no longer take cash. Many individuals in lower income brackets don't have bank accounts and are completely wary of even prepaid credit cards. You're removing them from possible buyers even when those are the people that will often be the most loyal when you treat them with respect. Not to mention kids used to come up to our trucks to buy ice cream, kids don't have credit cards. Now I'm making the kids feel bad which means their parents won't be buyers ever either.

5) this is 2021, word of mouth isn't gonna keep a company in business. Apple, Google, Walmart, Coca Cola, Pepsi, huge name brands that everybody recognizes still advertise because they understand they still have to create new consumers. We should be sponsoring YouTube creators and Instagram personalities and buying ads on major networks, yet the most this company has ever bothered to advertise was a coupon in parade magazine... parade magazine, i hope whoever made that decision was fired.

6) if i report an issue with my truck it will never get resolved. Doesn't matter how many times i complain. For example our headlights are dangerously dim, you report it they replace it with the same cheap dim brand that doesn't work, maybe spend 5 extra bucks and make sure you get working equipment. 

7) we used to have competent in house support and phone ordering, the company chose to replace them with people that don't know what they're doing... that's a smart move. 

8) if a customer complaint comes in instead of being accusatory to the rsr maybe say to yourself ""hmm this issue has never arisen in the eight years they've been with the company, let's ask them what happened."" Before you make any judgements

9) there is no upward movement within the company, even if we apply only outside people are hired because you just want ""yes men"" rather than someone willing to tell you no because something is a bad idea and makes no sense from a sales perspective. 

10) you allow our inventory to dwindle to nothing and still expect us to make ever increasing sales. How's about paying more at the manufacturing level so people will be incentivized to actually return to work? It may cause cost increases but inflation is a thing right now so that inevitable any way. Might as well try to stay in business too. 

11) I often don’t know what I’m gonna do next week much less at any point next year, stop making us pick vacations months in advance. 

12) this company can not properly route a day…period. Control of the route should be directly in the hands of the rsr because they know the area. I shouldn’t have to keep going to the house of someone that’s been dead for 6 months because the company refuses to remove a person. The rsr knows this information and can fix it. I shouldn’t be working in one town and suddenly notice am in stop in a completely different town in the middle of my day. You say a few bad apple spoiled it in the past… fire them and leave the rest of us alone to do our jobs properly.

And you may be wondering why I’m not giving notice and just quitting. Even if i did give notice and left on good terms this company marks all former employees as non-hirable. So why would i do you a courtesy if you won’t do one for me.",12/10/21 22:53

Walmart should be ashamed,52,rdi4ob,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdi4ob/walmart_should_be_ashamed/,22,1639169014,"Walmart just got me very irritated and here's why:

My wife likes to make those pick up orders from Walmart, we are in the US. Today she had me go pick up an extraordinarily large order to the point where it required 2 employees to bring it to my car and filled the entire vehicle. 

After they finished I went to the back of the car to thank the employees and apologize for having such a large order. I went to hand them each a 5 dollar bill and said go grab yourself a drink or snack on me. Reader, you should've seen the look of fear in these kid's eyes.

It's at this point they inform me that they are not allowed to accept gratuity from customers and just had a meeting this morning in which they were told they would be fired for accepting it. Who is Walmart to decide that I can't show gratuity to our personal shoppers for doing what they do? Why in the world would this be a policy? Gratuity is supposed to be directly from the consumer to the employee helping them, they should not even be involved in this process, it's also the main reason I always tip in cash. 

Ultimately they both refused the tip and handed it back to me while waving their hands no. Walmart is another company posting record profits and pays their executive team handsomely. Why would you deny these kids making 11 dollars an hour their tips from appreciative customers like me? End rant but how ridiculous of them.

Break time hat,12,rdi03n,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdi03n/break_time_hat/,11,1639168667,"Good day comrades,

One day while I was on my break, I was walking to the break room after using the bathroom. My boss saw me, approached me, and began assigning me tasks to be done immediately. I told her I wasn't even halfway through my rest break, which I was barely able to take on time. She got mad at me for wasting her time and stormed off. Hahaha, anyway...

The next day I showed up with an orange hunting hat in my backpack. A few days later my boss sees me wearing it and asks why. I tell her ""it's my break time hat, and it lets people know I am on my break and would like to be left alone."" Right after I said 'break time hat,' her face briefly flashed an angry look.

She replies ""\_\_\_\_ I'm just making conversation, why are you being so hostile?""

I say ""I choose to spend my breaks alone. Please respect that.""

She huffs, says ""you're being very disrespectful,"" and walks away.

I encourage y'all to adopt the practice of signaling break time with clothes. It can help keep your boss from harassing you during breaks and can make documenting that the harassment occurred during break time easier because people will see the orange hat and notice you. Even if they don't know the context of the hat, they will be much more likely to remember your boss talking to you because of it.

Praxis suggestions or thoughts?

Oh, and this was a summer job that was hiring in august. Multiple staff members walked out. I was hired in august and stayed for the rest of the season. Honestly, they did not deserve the quality that I put into my job. I sort of regret giving them effort. Emphasis on “sort of”, since most of the managers were great- except for one. I’ve replaced that managers name with “Lindsey”. I’ve also replaced the coworkers name to Sam, consider this as though my name is Samantha (it isnt) There was an indoor and outdoor section to the job. Indoors it was a store and food spot- we sold hot dogs and nachos and whatever. Note that the job also mostly hired teenagers. Also, if you were working on a weekday, it would probably just be two people in the store- one on register, one on food. (Sometimes we didn’t even have that.) It was also on a beach, so the customer area would be covered in sand after just one group of people showed up. So it wasn’t as though cleaning in the middle of a shift was super useful unless there was a mess. 

[this message was after working outside]:
“Today was hard at work. Busy. Hot. Lindsey was all like ‘I don’t pay you to sit’ and I was mentally like ‘It’s way too hot out, I really don’t want to pass out today, but HECK, I ain’t paid to sit for a few minutes before another wave of people come in. I was noticeably shaking by the time my shift ended.”

[this next message is after an indoor shift, also being the closing group.]

“Work was really stressful today. Not because we were busy. No. No no no. It’s because Lindsay was the closing manager. Lindsay is an older woman and she works at [company]. Ultimately, she’s probably the worst manager to deal with. Her whole philosophy is that even if we aren’t busy, we should still be working. She got mad at me because I didn’t move the tables to sweep during the middle of the day when customers were coming in every couple of minutes.

Cool fact: we don’t NEED all three food machines all the time. We only NEED one to serve food to people.

So it’s an hour before closing, and Lindsay wants us to be busy. I ask her if we can start closing tasks and she says yes. So I remove the food from one of the machines and turn it off to cool. She gets mad, because there are still customers coming and we need the machines. So I turn the machines back on and wait for closing to turn them off.

So Lindsay and the boss are doing closing manager stuff, and I’m cleaning the machines, and I overhear Lindsay talking to the boss saying “I’m not sure the employees close properly every day, since they leave earlier and we’re still closing.”

A few problems with that, Lindsay:

We usually don’t have all three machines running on the weekdays, only two. The machines take a lot of time and effort to clean, so yeah.

Usually the closing manager helps, mostly prepping the sinks. (That day, I ended up going home smelling like bleach. Probably not a good idea to leave pouring chemicals as a job for a teenager.) 

It’s a lot slower, because people keep avoiding you, because NO ONE LIKES YOU LINDSAY.

I’m not the fastest person at cleaning.

Oh, one last bit. 

I was cleaning the machines, and Lindsay calls for “Sam” to restock something. I know that’s my coworkers name, but I still respond to that. I say “I’m a little busy right now” because I was. 

Anyway, she’s like “I wasn’t talking to you”

“Okay”

“You should really be more respectful, I’m your boss, and if you don’t like that, we can change it.”

[end transcription of message]

So yeah, that’s my explaination of what happened that I sent to my sister several months ago.

It’s a pain in the ass but fine. Whatever. Nothing really new. 

So right as we open a sketchy guy walks into the store and putters around for about an hour and a half. I can already tell he’s not going to buy anything and that he’s just trying to kill time or stay out of the cold. Not a big deal. Happens all the time in the shitty neighborhood the store is in. 

The guy then leaves a pile of clothes by the register, waits for me to be busy helping out another customer then grabs the clothes and runs out the door. The owner of the store then chases after him, leaving me by myself! I have no idea what to do or if the owner is alright or anything.  So I do what I think is best and wait for the two customers still in the store to make their purchases then lock the door behind them. 

The owner then comes back a few minutes later and then proceeds to get mad at me for locking the door! I tell them that I don’t have any training in dealing with robberies and that they didn’t give me any instructions when they chased after the guy. So as punishment I was then demoted from shift manager to sales associate, literally the same job but with less pay. FUCK THAT! Put my keys on the counter and left.

Worked long hours, took on additional roles when others left, did work well above my pay grade. At my mid year review, my boss told me that if I wanted to promoted to manager, I needed to do x,y,z. I did xyz and he agreed and also gave me extremely positive feedback. Then he informed me the promotion wasn’t going to happen. 

I was upset but hoped it would be made up to me in the form of a good bonus and raise. Before I could find out what those were, though, a former boss of mine reached out about a similar role at a similar company, same growth potential but MUCH better pay and benefits and less hours. 

Wanting to give my boss the benefit of the doubt, I went to him and said I wasn’t not looking, but a former colleague of mine reached out about an opportunity and I had a competing offer. I asked if they could try to match that offer as I wanted to stay. 

Instead of being nice or trying to match, or really doing anything to thank me for my hard work and contribution, my boss gaslit me, tried to give me negative feedback (which he never had prior), said they could not come close and that my role and position wasn’t worth that much. He warned me that I was “chasing the money”. He basically said the manager thing was never on the table and that my expectations were unrealistic.

While I'm sure this sub doesn't represent every single job and profession ever, a lot of what I've read here is  outright horrifying and frankly disgusting from the employers, managers and bosses in the US.

Power hungry bully managers who put up little passive aggressive signs and can't even spell basic stuff correctly, firing or giving employees warnings over meaningless bullshit nobody in their right mind would even care about, speaking to employees in an awful way as if they're not even human beings, denying people pay, breaks, time off, someone on here recently said they had a manager micro managing their toilet breaks and telling them they'll flush the toilet for them - what the fuck!

Some of it genuinely reads like made up stories, in the sense that I just refuse to believe actual humans in jobs, where you're supposed to be professional and courteous, would act this way.

I was in the US literally 2 weeks ago visiting and I could swear every single fast food place or supermarket had a big sign out front saying they're recruiting now. This is in line with what I've read on here.

I've been in my job over 5 years and recently had a bit of a rough ride with a pathetic worthless weasel bully of a 'manager', but was lucky to have a very supportive HR who shut that person's bullshit down fairly quickly.

Let’s say you were looking for what most consider a minimum wage job. We all know what you’re referring to. It may mean, you’re looking for part time work for a little extra spending money or you lack the skills or experience or time devoted for a job that pays better. 

Why would you take an $11/hr job when there are places paying $15? Why would you volunteer for fast food or as a server when you could work in a department store or another form of retail? 

This also goes for those currently employed. If you’re making $12 “flipping burgers” and you heard new hires are getting $15…. Why would you not say anything? Why would you stay? 

This anti work movement is more than just quitting places. It’s about raising awareness to your own worth. Making workers aware that they have value. It’s not just about the dollar amount, it could be about convenience to your home, flexible hours and scheduling, doing something you feel comfortable doing, and building experience for down the road. 

There’s nothing wrong with sharing wage info with your coworkers. You should want to be treated with respect and fairly. If not, there’s literally a million places hiring. If you don’t like how you’re talked to in an interview, leave because there are a dozen places in every town hiring. You don’t need to take crap anymore. Companies need you. Granted, you’re still required to work. You’re not getting paid for nothing but it should still be a fair and respectful professional workplace. And if not…. NEARLY EVERY COMPANY IS HIRING.!!!

At the core. Privileged people just don't hold those beneath them as having equal value. Poor people suffering is just part of the system, it's what they deserve.

Raising the minimum wage might be a good thing. More money means more purchasing means more customers. While managers might want to fire people, they can't since the increased demand needs more employees. There's a lot of debate but economics have a consensus that raising the minimum wage is a good thing. There's even research showing an improvement.

But, the resistance was never economic, it was social. The real issue is that a lot of people don't think employees deserve much more than they're already getting.

""Fast Food Workers: You Don't Deserve $15 an Hour to Flip Burgers, and That's OK.""

Going through all economic arguments to get why people simply don't want others to earn more. The reason is simple. Minimum wage workers don't deserve a living wage. That's the true source of all our problems. It's why even now people are resisting increasing their minimum. The fact that so many people don't have insurance can barely afford to eat, and are stressed out is not a problem in many people's eyes.

The solution is always the same. ""Want to earn a middle-class wage, find a middle-class job.""

Of course, they're bluffing, people don't want workers to just try and leave to find better jobs. That's what's happening now and they're furious about it.

The philosophy is ""You get what you deserve."" If you get a minimum wage job, you deserve such. The fact that people are born with disabilities, or born within poverty doesn't matter. Even if a person is born disadvantaged, it's still their choice to raise. Being born poor is never an excuse.

It's elitism where people think they'll do better if they were in the poor's shoes. The poor don't know how to use their money. The poor are lazy. Even if we gave them money, they'll lose it within a few years.

It's a cruel form of a meritocracy where the right to live is something you need to purchase. And those who didn't get an education to even know how to crawl out of poverty are blamed for their ignorance.

"" **What would happen if the rich became poor and the poor became rich?""**

*""Then the best and the brightest people who created the wealth would create new wealth for themselves within one generation and most of the formerly poor, now nouveau riche would poor again within one generation because they are too ignorant or lazy to make money on their own and know nothing at all about managing it."" -Quora answer*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This also explains the resistance against universal healthcare of any form of welfare. The economics don't matter, especially since in both cases the results are good. Welfare allows children to get out of poverty thus adding more taxes than they used. And universal healthcare would save money by circumventing insurances.

But, people who don't deserve healthcare will get it. That's the issue. People don't want their taxes going to people they don't think to deserve it. Even if it benefits them. 'Welfare queen' is just a racist stereotype where people imagine undeserving women living off their hard work.

The fact that wealth is distributed along racial lines is no coincidence. It's no coincidence that the 'lazy poor' are disproportionally POCs. This isn't a new thing. It's how it's always been.",12/10/21 22:11

The reason I ask is with everything going on, and the amount of employees that actually work below a living wage, it's really difficult for me as a consumer to find and select places that actually pay properly. Pay properly. If this information was really available, I know that I would incorporate that information when searching for restaurants.

Just a thought, I'm not a web developer , and I don't really have a dog in this fight per se.

Like what if the McDonald's down the street from us had information from 6 to 10 employees, for example and the information that those employees put into the app or map, whatever, showed that the average employee received 40% of a living wage. I could then find restaurants based on their living wage rating and I or others could use that information to make decisions.",12/10/21 22:07

A few weeks ago I made a post about how I was by myself and was working nonstop, and I snapped. I was at the store and decided I couldn’t take it anymore. I told the customer service assistant I was done, and WALKED OFF THE POST(keep this in mind). At home, I didn’t even answer my managers phone when I got home, sealing the deal that I didn’t want the job anymore. Well shit, the next day he called me to the office and practically begged me to stay until he could find someone else in the next few weeks. Well I decided to stay. Yes I know I am an idiot for staying, but I honestly thought he would be able to find someone. Nope. My last off day was Thanksgiving, and I got lucky because the store was closed, but I still had to go back the next day. Yes I did ask about getting a raise but he had already increased it before and couldn’t do anything about it, apparently. I couldn’t get yesterday off because my manager couldn’t find anyone to cover, and he just spontaneously had to go to the doctor, so he couldn’t go. And then he switched my three off days from the 12th-15th to the 19th-21st. I have been extremely patient and stupid, but I really believe this man is playing me. For anyone wondering, I live in Alabama, and I looked it up, and this is totally legal. Workers over 18 are allowed to work consecutive weeks without an off day, so there’s really nothing I can do. I already tried walking off, but it didn’t work for some reason. I thought walking off your post and not answering the phone meant “I quit.” Yes I am an idiot.

I thought salaried meant you get paid the same no matter how many hours you work. So, if I get my job done in 6 hours, I should still get paid for 8. 

The other thing...I am required to work 9 hours a day (30 min lunch break, so really 8.5 hours). But if I take a vacation day or call in sick, I use 8 hours of PTO time. I do not clock in or out, and I am supposed to fill in a time card on the computer weekly. The time card is automatically set to 8 hours, 5 days a week and I am not allowed to change it to say how many hours I actually worked (45). 

Literally all of my coworkers work 8 hour days. Except the boss who works 9-12 hours a day. And comes in on his days off. He is a middle manager, so it's not like he's a big wig and should be working this much. 

My concern is that I occasionally leave an hour early for doctors appointments (working 7 hours that day, 1 hour less than everyone else), and ask my boss to make up that 1 hour on an other day. I ask to work 9 hours the next day (1 more hour than everyone else) and his response is that our company requires 9 hour days. So now if I want to leave an hour earlier than everyone else I have to work 2 extra hours to make up for it.

I was a trucking supervisor in the oilfields of Odessa Tx. I was field  training a man named J, proud yet kind man from Mexico.  J. Had a difficult time learning the computer system. He would follow me place to place, me in my truck, he in his. When we would stop I would show him hot to manage. his electronic logs and load manager. I did this for a week. He would always thank me for being so patient. 
J Kicked ass after he learned the system and was incredibly proliific. I taught him heavy haul securement and he made big bucks moving frac equipment for the company. 

J. Was dispatched to New Mexico, He came to see me and was a bit frantic, claiming he could not go. I asked how come? J. showed me all his paperwork, he was on  state supervision, and had completed 8 years in federal prison as a cartel member money laundering. . He had Federal and state charges. I re-assigned him to South Texas until New Mexico was completed. 

J. and I lived in the same man camp, we ate dinner together and on a days off would go out to eat. One time I asked him a couple of things about how he handled business in his old life. How he collected money if it was not paid, he told me a story that I am not going to repeat to anyone, he called it disappearing you. I asked J if he sent people to do these things? He said no, I personally took care of my business. I don't talk to him much about his past, the less I know the better. 

What I'm trying to say is. you might be supervising and x sociopathic  Killer and not know it. Best you treat everyone with professionalism and kindness.  I wonder how many people  who are genuinely trying to make it in the world trying to go legit after prison and they come across that insensitive self-agrandizing, arrogant power tripper pushing employees to the edge with stupid comments and unessessary disrespect.

I missed my third day today but didn't bother to call in because I was so tired and already sick of my job.

I go in on my first day and they tell me they have no break room but only a private area blocked off by a divider to sit down. A microwave on-top of a cabinet and a mini fridge. Then they tell me I can put my stuff in the bathroom on top of a rack. 

All of their information and values about store policy is in the bathroom so during my orientation I had to stand in the bathroom to read it all and that not even the worst part. It's the only job here in Ontario that does not give you a break if you work 4/5 hours. 

I thought that was illegal because every job I've heard of here has a policy of a 15 minute break for a 4 hour shift. Turns out they are just extra crappy by exploiting the law. Turns out the law is I only need an eating break every 5 consecutive hours of working. Bet they wouldn't give us a break if they didn't have to.

I'm already tired of working there as there is no such thing as sitting down for me as I'm part time with 4-5 hour shifts and even while doing training on the computer I have to stand. Maybe I'm complaining too much but I even got better treatment as an employee at Value Village and that's saying something.

So my story is the follow: I'm a Journalist, that's my dream job since i was a kid, now I'm 30. I did all the usual step by step progress most of us do: started writing on blogs during University while doing some paper job on the side of studying. 5 years ago a local TV contacted me to work with them. Keep in mind I'm talking about a region where there are very few local news outlet (2 journals, 2 television and 2 online journals). I've worked for them for the last 5 years EXCEPT I don't technically ""work for them"" because I was never hired instead I work as a freelancer. That means no paid vacation no sick leave of course and I also have to pay my own Job related taxes. I kept my head down and worked my ass off thinking at some point they will hire me but, despite several promises in that regard, nothing ever happened and the pandemic hit gave the Manager another good excuse to postpone my hiring. Fast forward to Fall 2021 and on an unrelated matter the Journalist Union put a focus on the situation on the Company and noticed my unusual and unlawful working agreement. So the Company, scared about a lawsuit, put me on hold from work until my situation was normalized. I've been out of work since the start of november and now, after a month, they finally made me a contract offer which is honestly ridicolous: basically 1100 Euros per month for 36 hours a week and for 18 months only. The union told me not to accept and to sue the company saying I could get as much as 100k from a cause they say I'm pretty much guaranteed to win. The problem of suing is of course I would need to find another place to work and, as mentioned above there are not a lot of those here in my region and I would not want to move.
So I'm basically fucked either i accept an offer way below my worth or I go to trial with the company and remain unemployed. I honestly don't know what I'm going to end up doing and would love some feedback. Thanks all in advance!",12/10/21 20:59

I moved from PA to TX to help a ""friend"" grow his business. It was presented as an awesome opportunity with no way to fail short of lack of trying. 
My position was to handle all sales and some production. I was stoked! So I bought a home, gathered my shit and made the 1500 mile move back to Dallas, Texas. 
Dont get me wrong, I am grateful for the job because it allowed me to move out of my heroin riddled hometown. 
This position was described as a ton of money, future benefits and as much growth as I wanted. 
I am now one year in. I have grown the company from 60k sales its first year to 400k in sales since I started. 
I've landed several massive accounts and have never called a single day off. 
When I asked for vacation time to see my family: ""I cant afford it I'm a small business owner""
When I asked for benefits: ""I cant afford it I'm a small business owner"" 
When I asked for a raise: ""I cant afford it I'm a small business owner"" 
Last week he told me that he sold the business for 100k profit and new ownership will take over in the new year. 
When I asked about a Christmas bonus because I'm taking time off to go visit my family on unpaid vacation: ""you'll have to ask the new owner about a Christmas bonus"" 
I pulled money from my savings account and filed my LLC last week for my own business.
If you google this business and read the hundred 5 star google reviews, most mention my name. I am the only employee who has been here since the start and the only salesman. 

I have made this man more money than he ever imagined and he literally would not cross the street for me. 

To answer any questions I see coming about: 
Do I make commission? Yes but only on in house produced items. This is fun because since he implemented this program, he outsources literally everything he can. 

This is a soul crushing experience. I will come back harder than ever but after hearing 0 Christmas bonus for the single human who brought his business success, I'm fucking livid.

A trade association is:

“A trade association, also known as an industry trade group, business association, sector association or industry body, is an organization founded and funded by businesses that operate in a specific industry. An industry trade association participates in public relations activities such as advertising, education, publishing, lobbying, and political donations, but its focus is collaboration between companies. Associations may offer other services, such as producing conferences, holding networking or charitable events, or offering classes or educational materials. Many associations are non-profit organizations governed by bylaws and directed by officers who are also members.”

Recently, Starbucks as taken issue with employee unionization efforts. A labor union is:

“A trade union (or a labor union in American English), often simply referred to as a union, is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals, such as protecting the integrity of their trade, improving safety standards, and attaining better wages, benefits (such as vacation, health care, and retirement), and working conditions through the increased bargaining power wielded by solidarity among workers. Trade unions typically fund the formal organization, head office, and legal team functions of the trade union through regular fees or union dues. The delegate staff of the trade union representation in the workforce are made up of workplace volunteers who are appointed by members in democratic elections.”

Being in a sinking ship of a business is painful to live through.,9,rdfo4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdfo4l/being_in_a_sinking_ship_of_a_business_is_painful/,1,1639162455,"So I've been working in a small retail group of bike shops for as year or so now. I took the job to keep getting paid during covid and to transition into a  marketing career.

In a year our owner went from 0 retail experience and no business ownership experience to owning 2 bike shops. He bought a shop that was failing and renovated it, basically just repainted. A year later he bought our biggest competition that is exactly 1 block away from us. In his words he is"" playing monopoly"". Except since we bought the other shop we haven't been quiet about it and it resulted in all our customers leaving and going down the street because they have more selection and better bikes. Big oof.

Here's the big pain point. When he bought the other shop the entire staff quit Except for 2. It was a shop of 12 employees. I tried to help him find replacements, like quality people, skilled bike mechanics and sales staff was the goal. I wanted to post about our benefits such as vacation, massive discounts, ext. He didn't want to attract pay chasers and wanted pure cyclists who just get paid on passion. He quotes this as being akin to a drug dealer, his words. He pays people with discounts and bikes and they don't care or realize how little they are being paid. I'm talking like 14-17$ an hour for 5 years experience and professional bike mechanic training.

So to sum it up. The new shop is now under staffed meaning the owner is having to work at the speed of 5 people. They can't bring in inventory or build bikes fast enough to meet customer demand. Our original shop is over staffed with 3 employees and is making on average 300$ in sales a day. We are now on credit hold because we have a cash flow issue. Bikes aren't being sold and have been sitting for 6-12 months, but keep coming in. 

I am now being blamed for not getting sales up or getting customer in the door. I am quite new at doing marketing and sales, until this point in my life I have just worked in inbound sales, call centers, and retail. I have never needed to actually try and get people to come into a store and buy something. I need a lot more guidance then what i am getting now. I am going 5-6 hours a day completely alone with no customers or coworkers in some days. I like to think I am a creative marketer, but having no one to bounce ideas off of is killing me. I could make a blog about anything in the store, and we have thousands of products. But not having the guidance on what to focus on just gives me anxiety thinking about it. Too much to choose from basically.

I see both these businesses just failing in the next year or so. I have seen the writing on the wall. When we have pallets of products just sitting for months and no sales it's pretty obvious. I also see emails daily asking for late payments of tens of thousands of dollars. 

On the good side I have been applying to jobs over the last month. I am waiting on one that will will be exactly what I have been working for. Marketing, union, health benefits, super friendly people. I just feel bad because I don't know how long the shop will last without me.",12/10/21 20:54

My Story of Horrible Employment,2,rdfmjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdfmjc/my_story_of_horrible_employment/,0,1639162336,"To preface this, this is my first post on this subreddit, and I still work at this employer because despite the title I do enjoy the job to a degree, but I can't live off the income despite asking for raises and promotions many times. Names will be changed, no intended real-life connections for them.

So, about 3 years ago, I quite my abysmally abusive job at Kroger (story for another time), and got a job working at a dine-in movie theater. Let's call it... Reel Foods. This kind of theater, for those that are unaware, is one where you can order restaurant-style meals and eat them at your seat during the movie. It's rough at times, but overall fun. The pay was garbage and I was part time (still am despite being relied upon heavily), but I was in school at the time. It all was going well, had some good managers, had some bad, one that kept me until 2 AM when we closed at midnight, just to put cups away after being washed, which I always was concerned about because they were never dry. It was alright.

Then covid hit.

Lockdown lasted for a few months, and when we reopened I was one of maybe a dozen employees that came back, out of a good 50. Same wage, new procedures that wound up giving us less hours, and same bad benefits (no healthcare, free popcorn and soda on the clock, 30% discount on overpriced food). But it was okay in my mind because it was a touch and go situation. Then our yearly raises came in.

I got a ten cent raise for working during a pandemic.

We were furious. They had the gall to send out huge emails from the parent company thanking us for working during these stressful times and rewarded us with a raise that wasn't even half the average they'd pay. (25 cents for the average worker, a whopping 50 cents if you're god tier.) Thankfully, this was walked back on soon after because of the labor shortage, and we were all moved up from various sub $10 wages to a whopping $12 an hour. 

And things seemed alright again. Until this holiday season hit.

At first it seemed amazing. From Thanksgiving until the week after New Years we're getting 75% employee discounts, for the weeks surrounding the big holidays we get an extra $5 an hour and then time and a half on top of that on the holidays themselves. I felt like things could be improving. This week changed that.

I got my schedule in, which was my usual work schedule. Then, the general manager changed it, and cut me on Tuesday and Thursday. For reference, Tuesdays are big days due to a special promotion with cheap tickets and free popcorn, and this upcoming Thursday will be the day we start screening the new Spider-Man.

Despite being called the best employee to do the drink station by basically everyone, I was cut on the days I was supposedly needed the most. I'm planning on finding another job that can be somewhat more liveable (wish me luck on that, and tips would be appreciated, got an associate's in business technology) as soon as the holiday season is over, and I will quit this job. Thanks for listening to my ramble, and hope my story helps others get the courage to fight for better wages when I wasn't.",12/10/21 20:52

I had a doctors appointment scheduled for next week to get help with it and my doctor couldn’t see me sooner. Due to the severity of it at times, I was 5 minutes late to work twice this week. LITERALLY FIVE MINUTES when I’m usually on time. Both times were because I literally had to stop my commute to throw up due to the pain. I informed my manager of the situation, but because he “likes to run a tight ship” he demanded I pay $20 for a doctors note for those two days and get it before my next shift (today). $20 is roughly what I get paid for TWO HOURS of work after taxes. 

Anyways, I went to the walk-in clinic this morning before work. I had to wait until today because today is the day we get paid and I was broke after paying rent on the first. The doctor who I met for the first time blew all of my symptoms out of proportion (migraine, tiredness and red eyes from not sleeping well). He said that I needed to get tested for COVID and self-isolate until I get the results. Since it’s the weekend, I probably won’t get the results until Monday afternoon. 

Here’s the best part, since I only work 4 days a week and I was scheduled Friday-Monday I’m eligible to receive two weeks of covid benefits from the government in my country. Friday/Saturday being part of this week and Sunday/Monday being part of next week. The criteria states your eligible if your schedule is cut by 50%. So I’m getting $1000 to have a long weekend at home when I would’ve only gotten paid $325 if I had worked. 

After I tell my manger this, he said I have to come in because they’re short staffed and nobody can work but me. Then he accused me of lying. It felt great to say I’m sorry Sir but it’s the law, you’ll get your doctors note when I see you on Tuesday!

TL;DR: I was 5 minutes late to work twice this week because of a bad migraine. My manager demanded I get a $20 doctors note to excuse my lateness. The doctor forces me to get tested for COVID and self-isolate until Monday. Now my boss is fucked while I get a long weekend and paid 3x what I would’ve in government COVID benefits.",12/10/21 20:47

I work in medical imaging. The structure is techs, lead tech, manager. I’m a tech who is experienced and actually interviewing for the open lead tech position next week. 

The current lead tech always speaks to me so rudely. Last week, a nurse called him out because she witnessed the way he spoke to me and he actually came over and apologized. I’m grateful to that nurse. He has not become more cognizant of how he treats me though. I don’t know why he has a chip on his shoulder about me. He is stressed and overworked being the only lead but he’s perfectly nice to everyone else from what I’ve observed. 

Today I worked at a satellite location and called him after my lunch break to see if he wanted me to go to the main hospital. He was grilling me about when I finished my last patient and basically accusing me of sitting here doing nothing. I finished working on protocols I’m building/improving (because image quality at this location is garbage), restocked linens and picked up after my patient. Then I went on my break. 

How can I confront this? Should I just be straight up with him? It affects my morale, I ruminate about it, and it increases my already barely tolerable anxiety.

He re-hired an employee who quit on him several times, because they were buddies.

I had gone through several temp agencies who sent me on some real shitty jobs, I was a semi-trailer cleaner for a day, the work was pretty fun and I did a good job but I had to go to the hospital because of the unsafe work condition and the fact my lungs were burned by the acid they used.

I was a laundry and shower manager for helping homeless people where I was threatened, was stalked, no breaks of any kind and on top of that the bosses said, ""you don't need to get paid, the experience is good enough"".

In the end I just given up on trying to find a socially expectable job and just draw porn commissions, and you know what? It maybe a bit of a struggle I manage to cover my bills a whole lot more than playing games with employers.

I have seen some comments on this sub from people I believe are working on behalf of corporate interests, I believe this to be the case because they are deliberately using what I call ""dividers"". Terms and narratives designed to split working class people apart to make us argue amongst ourselves rather than uniting for a common cause, usually disguised as leftist talking points but make no mistake, they are in service to corporate overlords. 

A favourite (and most effective) tactics used by these people is to invoke race. Race is a hot button issue and it's very easy to get reactionary comments which in turn spur reactions and it can spin out into a full blown argument, with the flames endlessly fanned by corporate shills working to break us apart. 

I have seen comments claiming that the kellogs strike is a chance for POC workers to free themselves from ""White slavemasters"" this is a common way that leftist language can be used to fuel a corporate agenda, using provocative language and planting a false mental image in people's heads of what's really going on. DON'T FALL FOR IT! the corporate media will push this too, they'll say that ""certain elements"" in the striking workers are ""white supremacists"" too without any shred of evidence because it provokes an immediate reaction of revulsion from the public and can easily cause leftist groups and movements to quickly collapse into infighting. 

People of ALL races are part of the kellogg's strike. ALL. A white man working 16 hours a day 7 days a week for barely 5 dollars an hour is getting fucked over just as much as a black woman working 16 hours a day, 7 days a week for barely 5 dollars an hour. 

Don't allow ourselves to be torn apart or start bickering when these tactics get used to distract us and make us turn against eachother. I've seen the left across the English speaking world devolve into a fucking joke since the end of the occupy movement by corporate interests using these exact same tactics. Only now is it truly starting to make a comeback and it's not through identity politics, it's through screwing over the top 1%, it's about organising unions and fighting for better conditions for the working class! 

Don't let yourselves be divided, whenever anyone uses these dividing tactics, they're wolves in sheep's clothing. Corporate shills wearing a thin mask of faux leftism. Beware of them because, they're here, and they're looking for ways to make us tear ourselves apart.",12/10/21 20:35

This was my first job when I got out of 90 inpatient mental health facility. (TLDR: GF cheated on me and was emotionally abusive, had a mental breakdown and had to spend time away to get my shit together).   I was hired as a food runner at a nice restaurant in FL, I kept messing up the table numbers and would say ""Thanks Chef"" every time he handed me a plate of food to run. 

Now, for context, every restaurant job I've worked at since I was 21 I would ask the GM/ Shift Manager if they would like to come out for a drink after shift (all of the joints i worked at, the whole FOH would grab a drink on a friday night, just to be polite and get to know my bosses a little more). 

Well, a few weeks of doing food running, I kept fucking up the table numbers/certain dishes at the tables. One day, I get to work and GM pulls me to the side and says im going to be bussing tables from now on. Not a big deal, same tips and pay, plus i get to actually talk to people at the tables while im bussing it down. 

About 3 months into bussing everyone is loving me, servers, managers, bartenders, and even a bunch of customers. Well, one night after shift we all go out for someone's birthday. As im leaving for the night, i ask the GM if they would like to join us. He says ""Ok yeah sure but only so you stop bugging me about it"" 

We get to the bar and a bunch of us are just bitching about the long shifts. GM gets there and shakes my hand and says ""You've been doing great recently"" I say thank you and offer to buy him a beer. About 30 min goes by and I mention to him how i would like to be a server after season ends (Around May, 3 months out). He laughs in my face and says ""The chef would NEVER make you as a server. (Chef's cousin owned the place, he basically ran it with the GM)

I asked him point blank. ""Why not?"" He proceeds to tell me how Chef hates me for being so polite and because i fucked up as a food runner and that he wanted the GM to fire me after i fucked up. I kind of laugh it off at first but it was kind of embarrassing that he said that in front of all my co workers. 

Once covid closed the place for a few months i found out that they may have stole my tips from me in season.

After 8 years of solid attendance and routinely good quarterly reviews, I was suddenly being treated like disposable garbage. All because I had to take 6 months off from work due to health issues.  

I'd gotten infected during the first Covid wave in Feb 2020 and subsequently had a heart attack in March 2020 from blood clotting issues and spent 6 months recovering from the mental and physical trauma. I have a severe family history of fatal heart attacks, 5 out of 13 aunts and uncles, including my father were all dead by 60 from heart disease and half of them had a first episode in their 30s. Needless to say, this scared the sh\*t out of me and I started having extreme anxiety attacks which left me hospitalised another 2 times with hypertension. The Anxiety got so bad I eventually had to break down and seek medication. However the side effects were almost as bad and I found myself having issues focusing, I couldn't remember basic things and would forget things I'd within minutes of having done them    

In spite of all this, after 6 months I started feeling ok enough to get back to work.  As soon I got back I felt a difference in behaviour from my colleagues. I had a new manager who was very combative and and narcissistic and within a few months I realised my job was under assault. Everything I did was was put under a microscope, colleagues whom I'd trained were criticising my work in extremely unflattering . It came as no surprise in June of this year when I was told I had put on an ""ïmprovement plan"". I fought tooth and nail and worked my ass off but nothing was ever good enough. When I started having meetings with the HR rep I brought up the fact that I'd had a severely traumatic experience and the side effects of my meds were affecting my work performance. I even pointed out that once I met a certain date off of them and the side effects would subside afterwards. This all fell on deaf ears and I was told what I'd written above.  Eventually I was told I needed to leave or my contract would terminated and I would ineligible for any unemployment benefits.

A Discussion / Understanding this Subreddit,0,rderji,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rderji/a_discussion_understanding_this_subreddit/,60,1639160004,"Hello. I come for meaningful dialogue. I identify as a centrist. I have views from both sides of the aisle and have a deep dislike for the lack of bipartisanship in today’s politics. To some on the right this makes me a “communist” and to some on the left this makes me an “authoritarian.” I’m used to it and don’t care that everyone hates me. But I contend that I do not violate rule 4.

As a background, I have a deep dislike for work. It sucks. I’d rather be on a beach. I’d rather be doing drugs and having fun with strippers. Maybe some people find significance in their work, such as a doctor who saves lives. I respect that, but I am not that person.

My view is that work is unfortunately necessary. We all need to eat and have shelter. Before civilized society, this meant going out to hunt, gather, and build shelter. That was work. We have now built a society where one can buy food without hunting or gathering it - through the use of money.

Money takes work to acquire. The government can print it to a point, but there must be an economy to tax to sustain the printing. So everyone not working doesn’t seem to be an option. You should choose to hunt or gather, but this is still work. You can sell your body, but this still takes work. The only exception to all this is if you’re gifted with money, such as through an inheritance. But the money still took work to acquire from the gifter’s perspective.

So I view work as a necessary evil. I don’t want to do it. I want to quit working as fast as possible. For me, that means taking a high salary now and investing as aggressively as possible. I hope to build up enough wealth where I don’t need to work.

This is my perspective. I am confused though by the perspective of people in this subreddit. It seems as though most people here still think there should be work. They are overjoyed about the unionization of Starbucks - presumably these employees still need to work. Do people here still want to work, but just cap it at 40 hours and pay higher wages?

It appears as though this subreddit is less about being anti-work and more about being a pro-union leftist. At least that’s what I have observed.

I don’t care about downvotes so feel free to give me one. But I do genuinely come in peace. I sympathize that work sucks. For me, that means sucking it up and getting to a place where I don’t need to work ASAP. I respect people who feel differently.

Where’s our responsibility?,0,rdeqku,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdeqku/wheres_our_responsibility/,10,1639159928,"I understand the desire for no work. For anti establishment. For demolishing capitalism (or as I would point out more accurately, destroying *crony* capitalism).

I get that desire. We live in a corrupt evil society full of greedy no-gooders. The reality is though this isn’t an issue with a system of governance or of economics. It’s an issue with human nature. We will always have people who want to steal from others. If it’s capitalism, communism, socialism, feudalism, etc. the heart of humans needs to be worked on. 

I would argue that to work on that. Is to work on responsibility. Carry weight. The weight of a job you don’t enjoy. The weight of a relationship that’s difficult but not toxic. (There’s a key line there in relationships, but we often in our day run away from them instead of compromise and work towards grow.) 

In our culture we speak of our rights in ever facet and space we can. No one speaks of how responsibility to your neighbors, your friends, your family, your job, yourself is what we need to become better people and grow. An end to work gives us an end to nothing that struggles inside us all. Our inner turmoil. The same turmoil human kind has been battling for centuries. What is my purpose. What is my role. Why am I here. Does this have any meaning? 

We’ll I don’t like my job. I’ve never liked any job. I’ve always searched for an external thing a person a place a new this or that to fix my angst. To rid my disdain for the job. Recently I’ve done something differently. I’ve become to look at myself to change instead. My job is still difficult but what in life isn’t? I want to be strong. I want to go towards the difficult task and I want t overcome it. I am not a victim of this society or this culture or this corruption. I’m an exception of it. I am growing to be bigger than it. I will do my part and carry my weight for the people I can. And I’ll make sure my heart is open and full and ready to give during the whole time. 

I will fail. But I will get up and try again. I won’t allow the inner voice of negativity to rule my actions. And once I’ve built the future I want. I will be strong enough to overcome those new challenges. Because working a job for someone else. Is nothing compared to running a whole operation for yourself. By yourself.

Assistance request from like minded humans,5,rdeosi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdeosi/assistance_request_from_like_minded_humans/,0,1639159796,"TLDR: I would like some help figuring out what to do in my situation. I've asked my usual people and haven't come up with anything viable yet, and I'm hoping the folks here will have some creative solutions.

**The Background**

It's taken almost 2 years of my being out of customer service work completely, for me to semi-recover (customer service burnout x100). I was out of work during pandemic year 1 (start of April), and pandemic year 2 (this year) I have spent in a 3 consecutive term, college trades program. 

**I'm finally beginning to feel like a person again; happy more frequently, excited about new tasks, and so forth.**

In this program, I got to learn and grow, enjoy things, try different trades, and meet humans from a safe-ish distance. I also got to use my free time however I wanted: develop skills in art and have fun; do research, hobbies and whatever I wished (within societal and personal financial constraints). 

However, this program is ending next week and my new, small and very fragile joy is at huge risk of slipping away. I mean, I'm trying not to think about it....but I know I will need to at some point soon, so I figured sooner is better than later.

**The Issues**

Problem 1: Mental & emotional health.

This program helped me realize how many cool skills I could develop--even trades I'd like to keep doing. However, the program also demonstrated vividly some issues in these trades, that I only overcame by reminding myself the program had a set end date, I'd paid for the class, and I could do it Just For Now. Whereas, if I were to take a job..... it wouldn't be the same. There is no end date to working, except death. 

I also realized that even though I enjoyed the trades in this program, I am once again upon its completion, glad to be done with the exhaustion of dealing with the bullshit that comes with other people and interacting with them (administration and professors; not fellow students). 

I don't want to be a hermit again (2020) but I also refuse to break myself anymore, for work. 

I do not want to and cannot, deal with the enormous mental and emotional effort, that comes with forced interactions with people and having to navigate them.

I can very easily see the experiences I had with such issues during this program, for example, turning into burnout again if they occured in a workplace. And that is one of many personal reasons I cannot do conventional work. Not that I do not want to; not that I don't wish I could. I simply cannot, without it adversely affecting me. But hating myself for having had trauma, or for my brain's abilities, is unuseful and unkind, so instead I'm upset at the systems which require forced labor under threat of homelessness, starvation, and indigence, and general suffering. I'd happily contribute if it wasn't a Do This Or Else hostage situation. Alas, it is. 

And I cannot willingly subject myself to a life where I work and come home to sleep and eat and repeat, so I have somewhere to sleep and eat so I can keep working; that's not a life; that's hell, and I'd rather they (capitalism) shoot me dead with some dignity, rather than fuck with me and refuse me dreams or a quality of life worth living for the next forty years. I'm simply unable to manage such. 

This leads to 

Problem 2: I'm concerned about what it will mean when I run out of funds, while being incapable of retuning to conventional workplace. 

As I see it, I either

1) need to make dollars another way outside of conventional workplaces

2) need to hope the world ends soon via zombies or aliens.

3) need to revisit the idea of my own non-existence. Which is unfortunate, because I'm finally enjoying life and wanting it to continue. 

Like, even though now I can see myself finding meaning and joy in being low stress, feeling safe, enjoying hobbies, making art, being a friend, watching tv series, going for walks, and doing research..... I'd be required to give all that up-- everything that makes my life manageable and enjoyable-- to keep a roof over my head, and food in the fridge.

By working I would stay alive biologically, but be simultaneously, by those very actions that would keep me alive, barred from keeping a quality of life worth continuing (to me). 

It's a maddening, beyond miserable scenario, and I hope to find a way out. I've asked folks I know for advice and unfortunately got shit from people who seem to be cognitively unable to process or understand what it means to not be capable of working in a conventional setting. 

Any practical advice folks here can give me are greatly appreciated. (E.g. lower stress atypical job options, ways to earn income more quickly so I could save funds and maybe start some sort of shop of my own eventually, etc). Hell, even just general comisserations of ""I dunno what to say except shit that sucks; I getchu"" are equally appreciated. 

**Important end notes** (which I add due to the prevalence of unhelpful or unkind comments I've unfortunately gotten in past) 

*please DO NOT suggest* that I 

A) ""seek mental health assistance"": I already have/ do/ am 😛 I have a therapist and I've worked with therapists off and on for many, many years. 

B) ""just pick something for now so you can save money"": 1. If I had the energy to do this I wouldn't be here asking these questions and 2. I've worked many, many ""stepping stone"" jobs, for many years, in the process of seeking better quality/ paying/ suited to me, options.  I've spent a great portion of my life doing this to no positive avail/ to the detriment of my mental health, to exhaustion and sadness.... not to mention living in the city I do makes saving impossible for a person working any sort of ""stepping stone"" minimum wage/ entry level job

We're short employees and need more workers so get a team together and re-apply, maybe we can hire you back for another portfolio.

I have been part of this organization for 5+ years. Things took a turn, and little to my knowledge the management team I was part of threw us in a six figure deficit.

This new blood, made everyone's life a living fucking hell. 

I had enough when people were being moved around without notice, their schedules changing without taking into account of their personal lives, seeing management ask my co-workers to find their own coverage if they wanted vacation time off, co-workers being harassed by management and then covering it up when a complaint was made and seeing some lose hours off their pay, twisting conversations to their own benefit...etc.

Between a small group of us, we started calling around at different unions within our region asking questions. One union wanted a minimum of 90 members, that was impossible ours was 1/3 of that. Until we reached out to one who took us in, as is.

Our voting turned out to be 90% in favour, now certified by labour relations and recognized as a union and currently in bargaining. It wasn't easy, and at some points we felt like throwing the towel because the process takes a long time.

That said, I dont want to completely delete this post, as other people may have a similar question. Original post below.


Among the calls for a boycott, I have been thinking a lot about if this would actually be beneficial for the workers. Hear me out, and please tell me what you think. I already dont buy any of their brands, so the decision to boycott or not doesnt really affect me.

There are definitely pros of a boycott. A boycott should theoretically hurt them where it matters most- in their wallet. If a large enough group were able to truly boycott Kellogg's until they renegotiated with the union, it would be devastating to the company. This requires a large group of people willing to sustain the boycott, with clear messages as to why they are doing it. But if the boycott goes right, it could be a huge help to the union workers- money is the only thing these corporations understand.

But there are also some cons to a boycott that are less obvious. A boycott is more helpful for Kelloggs in the short term. Their workers are striking, so they cant meet the demands of their distributors. But this also means they have a lot of cash that they arent paying to employees to help them ride out some bad press. A short term boycott will give Kelloggs Corporate time to figure out how to ramp up production without the union, while also maintaining their relationship and obligations to distributors. Currently, Kellogs has a problem of not being able to meet demand. By boycotting the company, the power of the union is weakened in the short term, as there is less demand for Keloggs to fill. Kelloggs long term solution may be that they let a small boycott continue for a while, giving them breathing room to hire scabs or find other ways to meet demands, and hope that once the news settles down they can basically get back to normal.

I literally dont know the right option. Have the Kelloggs union leaders asked for a boycott? I trust their judgment on the matter. There are a few other big names I might trust, but so far I haven't seen any of them, just people on Reddit.

Let me know if I'm wrong, but if a boycott is the right answer, it needs to be big, have clear messaging, and be backed by people who are willing to only buy kelloggs again if and when they renegotiate with the union. Otherwise I feel like we are making it easier on the company.",12/10/21 19:48

A fate worse than Sisyphus,5,rde2dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rde2dh/a_fate_worse_than_sisyphus/,9,1639158122,"
I know this is going to come off like “I’m Deep” material, but I honestly don’t get the point of life for the poor and the lower working classes under the US system today.

What’s the point of life?

Sisyphus had to labor to satisfy the sadistic cruelty of the gods, but you’re doomed to suffer so someone can buy their 5th rental property or 6th yacht. 

There is no point to your life other than the excess value that can be extracted from it. You’re like those factory farms that take the fresh born male baby chicks and toss them in a bucket to drown them, all with USDA govt. support to “stabilize” the market value of chicken. Your life only has “value” in the context of a market mechanism.

At least for the more prosperous white collar middle and upper classes, we have the promise of delayed gratification. That some amount of material reward will come and absolve us of any internal struggle about the contradictions between our internal values and the world we live in. 

The only reason we have any solidarity with the poor is because the “middle class” standard has been backsliding since the 70’s and Reaganomics took over. Otherwise, much of the middle class would probably be like the middle class of the 80’s and 90’s: deeply racist, lacking class solidarity, obsessed with “welfare queens” and demanding politicians to cut the social safety net. 

We in the middle classes only support the social safety net, Obamacare, free college, etc because we intend to benefit from those programs to hopefully live a future life of prosperity.

But for the lower and working classes, you don’t have a path to prosperity. I’ve seen it with my own eyes. People ages 35-60, working at or near minimum wage, maybe once middle class, but they’ve suffered some setback and been pushed down the rungs of economic stability. 

Walking to work in the winter, or taking two busses. No Health insurance. Maybe some crushing college or health debt. Spending 50% of their income on rent to live in some hovel in the worst part of town that requires a terrible commute with poor public transport.

What is the point of docility and going along with the system? To keep your $8 an hour job? To pay 50% of your rent to live in a boomers’ spare attic? How do you not write manifestos and go postal? 

You have nothing to lose but your chains. Honestly, the elites in our system will continue this system indefinitely until there is an uprising for political representation, labor unionization, and even possibly violent action. It’s not like the Indians, the Haitians, or the African American slaves got their freedom solely by marching peacefully. They only taught us about MLK because they don’t want us to know about Malcolm X and the black Panthers.

So I really don’t get why people seem so afraid of direct action even if they go to prison or die.

If you die the misery is over.

If you go to a (non-privatized) prison you literally get free housing, three meals, workout weights, a bed, and a free college education lol. 

They’re practically throwing people out of jails these days because they’ve locked so many people up on petty offenses like selling weed. Some states spend more on prisons than on their public education systems.

So how do you go on? How do you keep bringing children into this system of exploitation? How do you go to work everyday like lambs for slaughter? To have all your productive juices taken and monetized for market value? I don’t get it.",12/10/21 19:42

Manager wanted me to pay for a walkout as a server,157,rde1in,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rde1in/manager_wanted_me_to_pay_for_a_walkout_as_a_server/,15,1639158057,"Some time ago I was working as a server at a restaurant called Crawdaddys in Gatlinburg, TN. There was a meeting with all of the upper management of the concept as well as servers, restaurant managers, and HR. During this meeting a fellow server had a question about checks flying off the patio and how to fix this (it happened to her about two times before). The Director of Operations who was spearheading the meeting told the server to “Try your best to not let it happen.” and I immediately was pissed off at that response so I raised my hand and said “Can you give us a better answer than try your best, because that is an unacceptable answer.” I explained that we could find a solution together in less than 5 minutes. Needless to say I was on this lady’s radar for calling her out and probably embarrassing her in front of everyone. 

Fast forward a few weeks and I have this table, all but one pays with card. They walk out while I’m dealing with a different table and the one who didn’t pay with a card did not leave cash. I tell the manager what happened and she asked where I was when they walked out and I told her “Doing my job at another table.” After some time she comes up to me and says that they can discount the food but that I would have to pay the difference. I just looked at her and said “That’s not what the Fair Labor Standards Act says.” 

The look on her face was in astonishment and said she would get back with me. Several of the employees told me it’s happened to them before and they had to pay so I straight up showed them the FLSA and said that’s illegal and told them I’d walk out before paying anything. 

At the time the GM was on vacation and low and behold who does the MOD talk to for advice? That’s right the Director of Operations who became so fond of me. The manager pulls out the employee handbook and has sections highlighted that stated “misappropriation of funds is grounds for termination”. So when she was done with her speech trying to get me to pay I explained that if she could discount the food then she could comp it and she was choosing not to. Keep in mind this manager was new and so I purposely showed her the FLSA and explained it would be her name I put in the report.

I didn’t have to pay but she said I would have to talk with the GM when he was back. Of course this happened to a different server the next day and they paid for the walkout. When the GM was back I walked in and said good morning and he replied “Fuck this place.” I thought to myself that he was right so I set up the restaurant and just walked out. 

Long story short, don’t let anyone intimidate you and know your rights as a worker. Also don’t go to any Kennedy Concept restaurants in Gatlinburg or Knoxville.",12/10/21 19:40

A Boomer's Tale,47,rddxgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rddxgi/a_boomers_tale/,17,1639157753,"As it is the holiday season and many of you will spend time with your family, I thought I would share with you my friend, Paul's story. (just realized he is from the Silent Generation, not a Boomer).

Paul was a farm kid from Saskatchewan. Hated school and dropped out in Grade 9. Since he was not the oldest son, he knew he was not going to inherit the farm so he decided to move to Vancouver at 16. He got by there, since he was strong and could work hard, doing manual labour on construction sites.

At 21, he meets a girl and gets married. Now he realizes he needs a better job. One day he goes down to Vancouver City Hall and asks the receptionist for an application for the Police Department. The receptionist looks at him and says ""You aren't tall enough for the Police, plus they aren't hiring."" Dejected Paul turns to leave as the receptionist calls out "" The Fire Department is hiring and they don't have a height requirement. Why don't you apply there?"" So he fills in an application.

A couple months go by and  he gets a phone call. (Paul remembers this clearly). It was the Friday afternoon of a long weekend at 3 PM. The Fire Chief on the phone says to Paul ""If you still want to be a fireman go get a physical from a certain doctor. This has to be done before the doctor goes home for the weekend so you have an hour and a half."" 

Paul races across town by bus to get to the doctor's office. The doctor takes one look at this strapping, muscular farm kid and says ""well you obviously can pass the physical"" and signs the necessary paperwork without even doing the physical. Paul later realizes it wasn't about the physical, it was to see if he was sober on the Friday afternoon of a long weekend.

Tuesday morning he starts three days of training. Mostly physical fitness stuff. The last thing is the 'test'. The test is to hold a fire hose for 10 minutes without dropping it. The brass nozzle on the hose was 50 pounds or so plus the weight of the water and the canvas hose. It was a difficult task and most men failed. But Paul has been throwing hay bales on the farm and hauling lumber on construction sites for years. He is jacked. He has no problem holding the hose. That was it. He was now a fireman.

Over the years, he climbs the ranks based on seniority and becomes a Fire Chief at 50 and retires with a full pension at 55. (Now 85, his pension last year was $65,000).

Paul has a great life because of his job. 4 kids. Stay-at-home wife. He has a nice house, motor home, boat, vacations in the sun etc etc. All because he was strong and sober one particular Friday afternoon. (Plus the other qualifications of the time period - white, English speaking, straight & male).

I pass along this tale not to depress you but to confirm your feeling that things are different for the generations since. It certainly used to be much easier to get by and be successful. So don't let your grandparents get you down. It was simpler in their day (provided you were white, English speaking, straight and male)",12/10/21 19:35

All I know is that the last decade will go down in history as a turning point for the world.

In my lifetime (33F) I have seen (in no particular order) the rise of the internet, Occupy Wall Street, 9/11, the slow decline of American stability, the war in Iraq, incredible technological advancements, a global pandemic, the Trump administration, and now this subreddit. And I do absolutely consider this subreddit to be part of important moments in history. This subreddit is what I see as the grandchild of Occupy Wall Street - back then the demands weren't clear, and that's what killed the movement, but the passion and fire was real. And now we have a forum where we can build an actual movement with a clear understanding of the issues that line our corporatist society and say ENOUGH. The whole world has access to these forums, and are building something that I believe will change the world. We have 1.3m readers, and even if only 25% are actively working outside of this sub in the real world to make change, that's still over 300,000 people worldwide. 

Anyways, I just wanted to share that I think this subreddit is crazy important, and we are living in some very very interesting times.",12/10/21 19:34

Ghosted TWICE by the same consulting firm,8,rdduik,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rdduik/ghosted_twice_by_the_same_consulting_firm/,1,1639157542,"To give you guys some context, I am an engineer living in Western Europe, I am an immigrant and I chose Europe as a place to live after I graduated. 

As an immigrant coming from a developing country I had my share of bad interviews with recruiting personnel (a lot of passive aggressive racism) and people actively trying to ""scam"" me into shady job opportunities thinking I had no clue about the country's labors laws.

But I had an experience that really marked me and I wanted to share with you guys, to maybe shed a light on some abusive practices of consulting firms.

So right when I arrived at the country I chose to live in, I started sending a lot of CVs, everywhere and to every position I thought I would be a good fit. After a few months I had passed a lot of interviews but with no luck.

I started then getting a lot of responses from consulting firm and I passed a few interviews (I got used to their system of filling out a whole new CV with all the details of my accomplishments and studies and every consulting firm had their own document to fill or website to enter the information, really a time consuming thing).

After 3 interviews with a consulting firm they finally said they had an opportunity for me, but it was in another country (really close to the border of where I lived at the time, so I didn't care to move closer to the job's location). I accepted and they said I had to go there meet their affiliate and afterwards meet the client to see if it was a match. They said I could buy a train ticket and if I got the job they would refund me full, and if I didn't they would pay me half the price. I thought it was fair enough (at the time I was more than 3 months jobless, so I can say I didn't have much to spare but I had to give it a chance). 

I bought a train ticket (120 euros) and went there meet them. Everything went alright, and I left with a good feeling. The consulting firm said that they would wait the client's response and would get back to me. Finally a kind of a good news (as I thought at the time). 

One week passes by and I receive a call from the recruiter saying that he is sorry but the client changed his mind and didn't think I was a match. I said, ok and now what? They said they had another recruiter in the consulting firm that liked my CV and wanted me to meet another client, again far away from where I lived. He said they would again pay for my expenses. I agreed and this time got a bus ticket (money running short).

Again I met another client, everything went well, really a good feeling between the two of us. I left and debriefed with the recruiter from the consulting firm, he was really happy and said he would start working on my contract and all the details as soon as he gets a definitive answer from the client. So after two days I am back home and I receive a call from the recruiter saying the client said yes, and he was working on my contract and all was good. I was so happy, and said that I wanted to discuss the details of the contract, pay rates and what kind of benefits for moving to the other side of the country. After I said that he immediately changed his voice tone and said he would get back to me during the week.

Time passed, and no call from the guy, I sent an email and no answer. Tried calling and no one answered, during this time I remembered the first recruiter and how he was supposed to pay me at least half of my train trip, so I sent him an email asking about his colleague and if he had news about when they would pay me half the train trip. No answer. I tried calling and no one picked it up. I didn't understand a thing. I kept asking myself, why would they ghost someone that actually got the job?

At the end I managed to get a job in another company (not a consulting one) a few weeks later. But this experience really showed me how recruiters don't care about you. You are just a number and a bonus on their paycheck if you sign a contract. I was hoping they would call me at least to say that they f*ed up and they wouldn't be able to pay me back or that they didn't manage to make the client sign their contract, it would be better than just ghosting/blocking someone that was actually eager to work for you.

Tl.dr: I travelled half the country and paid 200 euros to meet some clients for a consulting firm and never got my money back (which they said they would pay back) and neither a job offer. Got ghosted by two recruiters of the same company.",12/10/21 19:32

"Congress, Coercion, and Capitalism",6,rddrqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rddrqt/congress_coercion_and_capitalism/,3,1639157355,"### How do we make things better?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see a lot of conversation on this sub about how much the world needs change. This change could be a 4 day workweek, universal healthcare, a $15.00 minimum wage, or any number of other things, but 2 basic commonalities exist to all of these proposals:  
&nbsp;  
-They could only feasibly be enacted through an act of law  
-They cost the wealthy a lot of money  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two factors ensure that the rich will never grant you such things through the goodness of their hearts.
### So how do we do it?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first answer for many is to vote, and the most important realization for those present here is that this method will never work in isolation. If Democrat politicians really wanted to help you, they very easily could. Democrats have held a majority in congress, sometimes a super-majority, many times, and have even held the title of president. What's stopping Joe Biden from pulling out the executive order at every employer who looks at him funny?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Democrat and Republican politicians are hardly mirror images of one another, it is important to understand that they are both acting as part of the same mechanism. Like a ratchet and pawl, permitting movement only in a single direction, the two parties continuously make our lives worse for the benefit of the rich. Democrats spend their time pacifying those who are unwilling to accept things as they are, and Republicans are occupied with convincing the people to ignore reality itself as it deteriorates around them. In a system with only Democrats, it would become immediately obvious that government had no intention of doing anything, and one with only Republicans would revolt almost immediately in the absence of a world-class propaganda department. A system with both permits an eternal stagnation, in which no improvements materialize. How then could things possibly be improved, if not at the ballot box?  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you know that, with over 3 million nationwide participants, the largest one day protest in the history of the United States was the 2017 Women's March? Most of you did not. This is the problem with protests - they are easily ignored. If the protestors conduct themselves peacefully, refuse to damage property, listen to the instructions of police, and maintain order, then they may as well have stayed home. The point of a protest is to inconvenience the powerful, and if you fail to do this you have accomplished nothing at all.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many will point to Martin Luther King Jr, Rosa Parks, or Mahatma Gandhi as successful peaceful protestors, but none of them acted in isolation, and they certainly didn't follow the instructions of the police. Each protested in an atmosphere already rife with impatience, where the threat of public violence silently loomed over the necks of the empowered. It is of course in the interests of the powerful, when they are forced to make concessions, to acknowledge the peaceful protestors as being the most effective, regardless of whether or not they actually were.  
&nbsp;  
### How do we convince them?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are of course forms of peaceful protest that aren't merely about getting together and waving signs around. One notable example is the consumer's boycott. I will say very little on their efficacy except that they cannot hurt. However, it requires both a large number of participants and a great deal of effort from all of them to be even remotely effective. One can see from other posts just how many brands one would need to keep track of just to cut Kellogg out of their life. In addition, this is not a good method at enacting economy-wide changes. Sure, if you don't want to buy food from big companies, you could maybe go to a farmer's market. But what about your car? Your computer? Your cell phone? You're not exactly going to be finding any small-town automotive plants, and a startup chip fab would be pure fantasy.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next method is the strike. Unlike a buyer, who has to buy every type of device and product they could ever need, a worker only has a few jobs (hopefully just the one), and can devote far more effort as an individual to crippling their workplace. They also have far more cohesion with their fellow workers, allowing for better coordination. However, a strike needs to have coordination to work. This is frequently what is undermined - by convincing employees that those who wish to strike are only doing so for personal gain, or simply to sow chaos, the workers can be turned against each other.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have theorized the possibility of a General Strike, in which a significant portion or even a majority of the entire population simultaneously abstains from work as a means to enact economy-wide change. Although we may be quick to dismiss it for the sheer number of necessary participants to create motivation, it is hardly an impossibility. Through the creation and collaboration of large trade unions, people in India conducted a general strike consisting of over 250 million people, if only for a single day. It is important to keep in mind the great number of points of failure in this method, but to dismiss it outright is foolish.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limiting factor on these forms of peaceful protest has thus far been in terms of number. Given that we live in a divided nation, you can count on only half of the population to support you even nominally, and many Democrats are not on your side once things start getting dirty. There are of course other means of protest. As a general rule, the greater the punishment assigned to an action, the more effective it is.  
&nbsp;  
### What do we do if they say no?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riot is perhaps the most controversial sort of non-peaceful protest. One cannot be mentioned without everyone in the vicinity announcing whether or not they approve of it. It is, however, undeniably effective. Riots themselves inflict little actual damage on the powerful, as their property is (obviously) going to be insured for such events, but when confronted with an image of a public so enraged that they are willing to flagrantly violate the law and face the violence of their heavily armed police, they become absolutely petrified. This is by far the one thing they fear most.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, leftists like to speak of *direct action*. For the uninitiated, direct action is when a coordinated group of individuals, usually a small one, takes some form of direct action (hence the name) to alleviate a problem. Direct action is not a form of protest - direct actors do not seek to convince those above them to solve the problem for them, they seek to solve it themselves. For example, instead of petitioning their government to enact climate regulations, direct action might consist of disabling oil pipelines, thereby directly halting production. Recently, this subreddit flooded Kellogg's scab recruitment page with fraudulent applications - this too is a form of direct action. Of course, not all direct action is illegal or even disruptive. Feeding the homeless could also be a form of direct action.  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When more peaceful means fail to prosper, and the people have been robbed of their voices, the only voice the people have left is the bellow of gunfire. The most extreme form of direct action is, of course, direct violence, where the powerful are removed from power entirely by simultaneously being removed from life. I will not speak at length on the topic, for obvious reasons, but it is important to keep this in mind. When the powerful grant concessions after a riot, they do so not because bricks going through windows is a particularly nasty occurrence, they do it because they fear this.",12/10/21 19:29

And finally if you dig into who owns who, the 3 firms among with other banks they own just form a pyramid and own each other.

Comment,1,ho45e7g,,0,1639226607,"Nah, the facts speak for themselves. Generally, if new information, especially raw data that you previously weren't aware of, can't change your viewpoint then you need to acknowledge it's based entirely on opinion - what you *want* to believe; what's *convenient* to believe. If everyone here thought that way, the movement would fail spectacularly.


I only mentioned your temper because you got disproportionately angry when your view was challenged; scrolling through your comment history didn't exactly change my mind. You seem to be into some pretty brutal stuff; commenting on the strategies of gory drive-by shootings and advocating for prison rape aren't exactly the hallmarks of a healthy mind. I have genuine sympathy for the woman that you hit, and I hope that you're getting the help you need to manage your rage. I'm sure the system that we live under is at least partially to blame for your anger; doing time over something as simple as a drug charge would probably make me angry too - maybe that contempt for the system is why you're here.. but you're not of any use to the movement if you're going to bury your head in the sand and ignore what's actually happening around you.

Comment,1,ho44w4x,,0,1639226285,"No, it was not preventable and The mask mandates have proven that thank you very much. You are claiming mask mandates lowered the numbers when states that have the highest restrictions and the most severe mask mandates actually had the highest infection rates; you are literally claiming the opposite of the truth that's why you and those that scream with you cannot be trusted.
Many ideals can dovetail that's why they're ideals.
No, wearing a mask all the time is not a healthy thing even the boxes themself say that improper use can cause death. No, doctors during routine visits have not always worn masks and you're not going to pretend that now.
If your vaccines actually worked, then the masks can be completely eliminated. I am exempt from having to participate in all of the things that you list.

Comment,1,ho43qsc,,0,1639225535,"No they're fucking scabs. In 2014 Kellog pulled the same stunt with a smaller strike. Later we got videos from the factory where we saw the scabs work ignoring all protocols and standards I think there even was a guy that peed on cereals. 
We saw the same shit happen with John Deere where they were replacing their workers with administrative guys and you had crashes with forklifts and 10 guys having to go to the hospital and shit.

Kellog threatening to fire everyone and replace them with non union workers is an empty threat that just isn't a possibility these days. It used to be possible because of rascist unions then you could go to the black community and resume all production. Then you had local people with a mix of skilled and unskilled workers.

These days we don't have a permanent underclass we are that class and we have no segregation in the unions. So Kellog can't pull workers from the local community because these are either company towns where or they would have to convince your neighbors to take your job for less pay.

Apparently they made ads to look for replacement workers but I would guess they outsourced the hiring of replacement workers and because these managers have always acted like the workers are unskilled and replacable they restart production on a line factory. That is insane and imo should be forbidden. In a line factory there is no halve speed production, you can't stop production partially. It's a continuous flow from the creation of the product until it's all packed and shipped. If a guy that puts stuff in boxes has to wait on a forklift to bring him more boxes you have a production stop for the whole line and if no one takes away the full boxes you have this stuff again. So created an environment that is dangerous for workers using machines they don't know to forklift drivers driving on full speed trying to catch up and they don't know the factory so have no idea which route to use where. This in a food production facility which brings an extra set of regulations.

edit: this is an article on the 2014 incident. It's a super biased article that blames the workers in my opinion. They say it happened during a labour dispute and Kellog is going to investigate it. A factory knows who was there when they just can't admit that it was Kellog's fault for using scabs and The Guardian is helping them by talking about a labour dispute instead of strike.

At 14 they are required to get a permit and the employer is required to fill out paperwork stating exactly what type of work the employee will perform.  At 16 most restrictions disappear though osha will forbid them from operating some equipment such as cardboard bailers.

Comment,1,ho43j1v,,0,1639225394,"I was a high end stripper, sugar babe, and e girl (all no contact, fully legal) for years. I'm also acquainted with insanely high-end escorts. I understand firsthand the privilege that comes along with that life, so I understand your wife's point of view. Probably even more-so, because I didn't have to screen anyone, I only worked when I had the staffing of executive security, and I had the safety of law enforcement behind me because I never broke the law.

I'm glad your wife makes a great living, but decriminalizing isn't about making Johns' lives easier/better or green lighting more people into the sex trade. It's also not about prioritizing the safety of the most privileged high-end escorts. It's about giving all FSSWs the same protections under the law that anyone else gets, which in turn makes the world safer for not just SWs, but also women as a whole. 

As is, high end escorts are generally not the focus of law enforcement. Both consensual and non-consensual FSSWs are still targets of violence because predators know that they may avoid going to police due to fear of prosecution themselves. There are literally trafficked children behind bars in the USA for defending themselves against men that trafficked/raped them. Look up Cyntoia Brown or Chrystul Kizer.

Prostitution is still more dangerous than any other profession. You say that your opinion is only in regards to high end escorting, but the laws aren't only applied to high end escorts (actually, rarely applied to high end escorts)- they apply to all FSSW, including the many that are less privileged, which you yourself acknowledge exist. 

""My wife and I are pretty sure we can go our whole lives without getting caught, since (at least in the world of high end escorting) only the stupidest girls get caught.""

The arrogance in this is astounding. We should still care about FSSWs that don't have the technical savvy or the pretty privilege to be deemed high end escorts. Note that trafficked women and children still catch charges.

""Screenings and background checks are extremely easy to do.""

Not for trafficked people and streetwalkers, they aren't. When backpage and similar platforms went down in the FOSTA-SESTA times, a lot of previously privileged escorts that were able to book their clients online and screen their clients before meeting face-to-face lost their safer client streams and had to freestyle to maintain their income.

Admittedly, I haven't kept up since the pandemic- so I don't know which avenues FSSWs are using these days and there may be something new since then.

""The argument I don't accept is when people make it out as if keeping it illegal is basically sentencing these women to violence. Screening and background checks are so easy and when high end escorts cite violence within the profession, they are coopting struggles of street walkers that they do not actually suffer from. The average high end escort lives much more like the wealthy men she services than she lives like a street walker and it is much more fitting to think of her and her job as being as oppressed as an attorney who owns his own law firm than to think of her as being subject to streetwalker problems.""

You're taking your extremely limited secondhand knowledge in regards to the most privileged bracket of FSSW and arguing against something that would benefit the majority. And honestly, as a man who will never face sexual violence for his job, you are completely clueless to the threat of sexual violence towards SW",12/11/21 14:23

So you’re saying that the USA, a known capitalist country, which has been known to embrace small business throughout its growth, grew to what it was through socialism, because small business is socialism?

And you’re also saying that the large greedy corporates we have now, which for the first time In us history are not being broken up as they become monopolies, ironically due to politicians people like you vote for, are in fact capitalism.

And you’re also saying the USSR, a known socialist country, which nationalized all business large and small, yes even mommy’s flower shop, was not socialist because they didn’t want small business.

I experienced the exact same things growing up that you are today.  Some might say worse.  I recall the oil crisis and sitting in gas lines with my parents on designated days to fill up our one and only car.

Black Monday 1987
Dot Com Bubble
2008 Crash Housing Crisis/Bank Meltdown
Savings & Loan Scandals

The blame lies on all of us for electing scumbag politicians who lie to us and then get into office.  And this isn't just one party, its both of them.  When you have a Congerss that is reelected over 90% of the time thats a problem.  Serving in Congress was never meant to be a career.  Everyone focuses on the person in the White House.  What that person does in four or eight years has far less impact to the health of our nation than the morons we have in Congress.  Why do you think they fight so hard to maintain control?  Its all about power and money.  Look at the laws they have passed and how they have impacted society and how rich they have become off of being a public servant.  

Take for example the 2008 housing and financial crisis.  That can be traced back to Jimmy Carter for the Housing Crisis and Bill Clinton for the Banking Financial crisis.  But both parties were complicit in Congress because in both timeframes the Congress was controlled by each party.  Remember power and money!

When you get angry at Boomers try to remember not all of them are rich.  And the ones that did manage to make it and save most of them earned it.  Also remember their parents grew up in the Great Depression and had nothing.  And if your parents are telling you don't expect anything from them maybe you should ask yourself why.  I read one comment where a Mother said she wasn't giving her kid anything.  I have no advice for you there.  There is obviously more to the story.

They're paid largely based on the size of the organization, so a merger / acquisition where they stay CEO, no matter how unprofitable, is nearly always a net win for them.

Studies often find they make little difference, and previous experience as an executive in some studies actually creates a poorer outcome for shareholders than somebody who's had no CEO experience.

The US CEO pay situation is the result mostly of factors that occurred in the past 40 years in our government, not factors inherent to capitalism: a system that for the past few decades legally privileges corporate indebtedness & growth over return on capital via dividends, extreme market consolidation in most industries due to the decline of antitrust regulation, the killing of unions due to the decline of labor law, and significant tax advantages granted to ""performance-based"" stock options in the 1980's.  Combined, these triggered a runaway arms race by corporate boards, which basically wouldn't have happened without changes imposed under the Reagan Administration.

Other countries didn't go through this escalation, and so you get situations where a $7B Japanese company buys a $500M American subsidiary only to find out that the guy running the American subsidiary makes $12M/year, and the guy running the Japanese company makes $1.1M/year.  The situation is frankly embarrassing internationally, because in countries that continued to develop as liberal democracies & never saw a Reagan parallel, this level of wealth inequality is considered socially excessive, just as we would consider Putin or the Saudi family's oil & gas wealth socially excessive.",12/11/21 14:19

They do all kinds of stuff if you need them. They check your contract and relevant stuff on legality, advice you what your rights are, probably a load of stuff a rechtsbijstandverzekering also does tbh. 

I could have taken a rechtsbijstandverzekering, but my dad adviced me to become part of a union. My dad was part of a company for 25 years, and when he reached 60 y/o, he wanted to work 4 days instead of 5 (even though he had been working 50+ hours for years), and his company didn't agree. They went to court, he won of course, and the union supporting him greatly. I've personally already seen some shady shit, so I really like the feeling of not being alone in it.

He did make films after but they mostly (with the exception of State of the Union) paled in comparison to what came before them (personally I have more love for the educational films he directed following It's a Wonderful Life).  It was eventually a success in release but was such an extremely modest one that it was a box office disappointment for all involved. 

 Liberty Films, the independent production company Capra founded with Samuel J. Briskin had limited financial resources and thought It's a Wonderful Life was a sure thing but wasn't as big of a hit as they had hoped.  In his autobiography, Capra mentions that Liberty Films couldn't count on any profits from the film for a year.  The film premiered on December 20th 1946 and was in general release in January of 1947 and had only earned 2 million by the time Liberty Films was sold to Paramount (Time Magazine, May 26, 1947).  I've read differing amounts as to the cost of the film, ranging from 2.3 million (the Time Magazine article) to 3.18 million (IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes) and that it eventually earned 3.3 million during its release (IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes again).  Technically not a bomb but so much of a financial disappointment that they couldn't keep things going after having spent so much on this film (much more than the average big budget film.  The costs of producing films were increasing, the box office was in a period of decline for the rest of the decade, and at the end of the first release at the worst estimate the film made less of a profit than the average amount Monogram spent on one of their films.  It was a company built by artists not businessmen so they sold the company to Paramount for stock and some film deals.  We got Shane, State of the Union, Roman Holiday, and others out of it so it could have been worse.

I just think audiences in the postwar period outgrew his films.  The films that followed were (State of the Union being an exception), for the most part, tired retreads of films from earlier in his career. He couldn't (or wouldn't) adapt to the changes in Hollywood (read his autobiography and how Claudette Colbert wasn't cast in State of the Union), his films just weren't speaking to his audience any longer, and I don't think he could reconcile himself to this new reality.  His complaints in the last chapter of The Name Above the Title always struck me as rather bitter, especially when compared to the rest of the book.",12/11/21 14:17

Comment,2,ho42vp1,,0,1639224956,"Would y'all like a story?

My husband is a (salary) engineer at a factory. The hourly folks are unionized. Several years ago it was contract negotiating time and it went poorly and the union went on strike. The company hired scabs. Now I don't know how typical this is, but per my husband (who had to continue to report to work like ""normal"", more on that below) the scabs were a group of guys who make traveling around together scabbing/temping in American factories their full time thing. He said they seemed nice enough and had experience with factory work *in general*, but factory work often requires very specific skill learned on the job to do well. It's hard work and you have to have a lot of practice to do it well (at least here). So the scabs were really expensive *and* really bad at the work. My poor husband got ordered by his boss to work as a shift supervisor so they'd stop ruining stuff (the guys on the picket line, who hubs gets on well with, thought this was a hoot). Eventually the company folded, the union guys came back, CEO got fired for wasting millions of dollars being stubborn, and my husband got to go back to his 9-5 in his office. Also took them years and $$$ to replace all the (non-union) welders who quit during the strike. We're hoping the company learned its lesson. Hopefully soon Kellogs will too.

Comment,4,ho42s9e,,0,1639224890,"I was working at a desk job, one afternoon and announcement comes over PA system that literally no one had even noticed was built into the building. The announcement stated that there was nothing to worry about and they didn't think that the package was actually a bomb so go ahead and continue working. The bomb squad was going to take care of it. Mind you no one had bothered saying anything up until this point. This was a 40 story high rise. I looked over at a friend of mine and said this sounds like an excellent moment to go take lunch outside of the building somewhere else. We both immediately stood up and left.

Apparently a suspicious package had been left right outside the building and the bomb squad had been called and was doing a controlled detonation of the package where it lay.

Pretty fucked up that they were half expecting the package to be a bomb but they wanted everyone in the building to continue working.",12/11/21 14:14

I used to work at a grocery store that was unionized, we were still paid minimum salary, around 7$ an hour, and we had to pay 5$ per week to the union. Some weeks I only worked 4 hours, so about 1/5 of my salary would go to the union...

At first, in the summer, I was doing more hours, but then school started, so I asked for less hours (other people in the group wanted more hours, so it should have been an easy decision), but the union had a rule, people that had worked there the longest had to get more hours. Since I started working there the morning the store first opened, I was the one in my group who was supposed to get the most hours. My boss had no choice but to fire me not to get in trouble with the union... I called the union, they didn't want to make an exception to their rule, so they refused to help me.",12/11/21 14:12

Comment,1,ho42btm,,0,1639224578,"Pros: collective power to tell upper management to stuff it. Better work conditions, higher pay, better benefits, possibly fewer hours, structured and not arbitrary raises.

Cons: none, aside from the very high probability that the bank will do whatever they can to union bust during the formation period. It could also be that many of the corporate employees believe anti-union bs and do not see themselves as the potential beneficiaries.",12/11/21 14:09

Take it up with Palahnuik then, since this is literally and textually how the novel and film represent it. The Narrator _is_ mentally ill, it is a fact of the plot, and arguably the central narrative element that makes the ‘twist’ possible. There are of course other themes in the story, but the Narrator’s mental illness is a core element that anchors the rest of the plot. 

>	just be a little bit more descriptive of the reasons people believe these things and why it’s wrong

People believe these things for the same reason that characters in the movie believe them. The problem is simply that people forget that the movie explicitly _rejects_ these ideas after introducing them. Tyler Durden is the villain, not the hero of the piece.",12/11/21 14:06

Comment,1,ho422tq,,0,1639224409,"I remember a while after the merger I started having that ""Blizzard just hasn't been the same"" train of thought. It's been really strange finding out that they were always *very* similar, even before then.

Honestly I'd been pretty disappointed with Blizzard as a creative entity probably since at least StarCraft 2. StarCraft was one of my favorite games for a long time and it felt like the writing quality coming out of the company changed pretty noticeably since at least WoW's Wrath of the Lich King expansion.

Anyway, my point being that I often wonder how much my disillusionment with Blizzard made it easier to deal with finding out they're actually a really shitty workplace. So far every notably employee that has been exposed as a creep has elicited an immediate ""fuck them"" instead of a ""not them too?!""

I think you can see this difference in attitude from people when you look at Riot. Riot is still a shit work environment with employees accused of misconduct (such as Greg Street, formerly of the Blizzard Cosby Suit) and even *currently under investigation*, but since it keeps making products that a lot of people still love no one talks about them the same way everyone talks about Blizzard, even though they're so incredibly similar.",12/11/21 14:06

Those Snackwells cookies, the chocolate cake cookies that were covered in the thin marshmallow coating, and then coated in chocolate?  The reason they no longer exist is because the facility containing the machine to make them was lost, and nobody had any idea how to recreate it.",12/11/21 14:03

One was very rude and would say suggestive things. And upper management wouldn’t ban them. I would’ve if I had the authority! No one should have to put up with that shit in the work place.

I had a supervisor once who would try to make sexual suggestions to me. I would repeatly tell him I had a husband and he needed to stop talking to me like that. He did this with several other married co workers . Thought it was funny. So one time I told him if upper management wouldn’t do anything, my husband was willing to come into my work place to talk to him about it. That stopped all sexual harassment.

Comment,4,ho41qj8,,0,1639224179,"Usually they have a union per sector, which function under one of those large national unions. Kind of like how many pension funds work. So FNV healthcare, FNV government, ABP (basically FNV police). And the same goes for CNV. And usually it is those unions who make a deal with the sectorial organisation (collective bargaining). Not everyone works under those rules, but nearly everyone does (>80%). Not as much as in the Nordic countries, which rely heavily on collective bargaining and have no minimum wage. But more than most other European countries and with a fairly high minimum wage.

All non union members benefit from the protection and collective bargaining if there is a union active in their sector. Union members get some additional support (e.g. legal support). Sadly, membership is dropping, I think people have gotten used of the protection given by unions while not being members, thus not seeing a reason to be a member. That is fine for now, but if it will continue, the unions will get significantly weaker. It is a trend that has to be turned around IMO.",12/11/21 14:02

You’re technically correct in this instance, but I’m arguing about the big picture here, that our government does not represent us. And that we’re indisputably (on economic issues) under one party corporate rule, with the two political parties varying a bit (mainly cosmetically, as neither addresses the underlying problems) on cultural identity and authoritarianism. Why do you think corporate media is obsessed with running culture war stories and inflammatory rhetoric? They’re running cover for the corporate establishment.

It also explains why they’re relentlessly shitting over the few non-corrupted progressives in congress, the only people actually fighting for the policies the corporate politicians claim to want to see passed. The reason: their corporate donors dont want it passed, and neither do the corporate puppet politicians, they do it every fucking time. Use progressive talking points to win elections, immediately abandon and get nothing done but platitudes, become unpopular, blame a rotating villain (Manchin/Sinema this time, Liebermann during Obama’s term) and if we had + 20 Dems in the senate. 21 would arise and say “its not fiscally responsible to do healthcare, or public housing, or voting rights, or economic reform and stronger workers rights” because they dont actually WANT it to happen… and the media runs cover for them and manufactures consent against anyone calling out their corruption or even hinting at it..

I've yet to be able to determine if the area was under tornado warning at the time. That's the only reason people would have known to take shelter. The only real strong point in this style of construction are places with substantial plumbing, but the employees would have been told where to shelter so they'd at least be able to recover the bodies.

I've also not seen anything that confirms a tornado hit the building. Dunno how much you know about US weather. The thunderstorms in the plains states can produce sustained winds of 70+mph and gusts as high as 110mph. It's most likely the building was engineered with insufficient safety factor, or had defects in construction.

If that seems cold and clinical what I'm saying is that this was more than likely a preventable tragedy that needs intense scrutiny. Unless the building was hit by a tornado that didn't trigger the alert system there was zero reason for anyone to die.",12/11/21 13:59
